00:02:15.903 --> 00:02:20.676
<v Nicolas Blank>justice. It really doesn't.
It was what I scraped off his LinkedIn</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/56-2
00:02:20.676 --> 00:02:26.231

reflection of of how amazing he is at</v>

<v Nicolas Blank>Let me start that again.
Choosing the right.</v>

00:03:05.174 --> 00:03:09.861
<v Nicolas Blank>I was doing so well up until that point.
Connectivity architecture for your cloud.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/65-0
00:03:06.754 --> 00:03:07.434

<v Nicolas Blank>I'm going to stop sharing and fumbling of

<v Warren du Toit>Thank you, Nick. That was really cool.
I really like that first animation.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/71-1
00:03:18.691 --> 00:03:22.234
<v Warren du Toit>That's super funny.
It actually really looks like me laughing.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/70-0
00:03:22.394 --> 00:03:22.434

<v Warren du Toit>I think Nick's pretty much said exactly
what he needs to say about me,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/72-2
00:03:34.413 --> 00:03:39.354
<v Warren du Toit>so I'm not going to say anymore,
except I guess I love what I do and.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/73-0
00:03:39.354 --> 00:03:44.434
<v Warren du Toit>I like to live in Azure.
Every now and then we cross over to AWS</v>

00:03:44.434 --> 00:03:49.279
<v Warren du Toit>because we have to,
but I don't love it as much. I'm kidding.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/73-2

<v Warren du Toit>With that, I'm going to share some stuff,
and please do stop me if there's anything</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/74-1

<v Warren du Toit>whatever the case may be,
we'll make plans to do something else.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/75-2
00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:25.128
<v Warren du Toit>And I'm also going to leave you with some
goodies. There's a wonderful human being,</v>

And also he provided me with a GitHub</v>

Are the routes actually working the way</v>

00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:29.893
<v Warren du Toit>Have you done your subnetting correctly?
All those lovely things and it's just</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/79-3
00:05:29.893 --> 00:05:32.916
<v Warren du Toit>it's beautiful.
It's got some diagrams in it and I'll</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/79-4
00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.827
<v Warren du Toit>send that to you a little bit later.
And with that,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/79-5
00:05:35.827 --> 00:05:37.954
<v Warren du Toit>let's hit the PowerPoint presentation.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/81-0
00:05:39.474 --> 00:05:44.794
<v Warren du Toit>And I'll do that and let's start O.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/83-0
00:05:46.634 --> 00:05:48.754
<v Warren du Toit>We're gonna go through.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/87-0
00:05:49.954 --> 00:05:53.242
<v Warren du Toit>What our backbone looks like as Microsoft
and Azure,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/87-1
00:05:53.242 --> 00:05:57.646
<v Warren du Toit>what it looks like around the world.
We're going to do some networking</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/87-2
00:05:57.646 --> 00:06:02.236
<v Warren du Toit>resources, how our routing works,
some of the network topologies that you</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/87-3
00:06:02.236 --> 00:06:04.594
<v Warren du Toit>can have inside of Azure Expressroute.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/92-0
00:06:05.034 --> 00:06:08.495
<v Warren du Toit>I have learned over the years,
instead of saying express route,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/92-1
00:06:08.495 --> 00:06:11.848
<v Warren du Toit>to say express route.
It's not because I want to be American,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/92-2
00:06:11.848 --> 00:06:15.634
<v Warren du Toit>it's just because that's how everybody
else around the world says it.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/92-3
00:06:15.634 --> 00:06:19.960
<v Warren du Toit>So express route is actually a thing.
Route means many different things to many</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/92-4
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.394
<v Warren du Toit>different cultures,
especially in Australia.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/95-0
00:06:22.474 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Warren du Toit>We express route, VWAN,
some resiliency stuff and then what Azure</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/95-1
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.472
<v Warren du Toit>Maps is.
So let's hope we get through all of it.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/95-2
00:06:34.472 --> 00:06:34.994
<v Warren du Toit>Oops.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/100-0
00:06:36.234 --> 00:06:39.887
<v Warren du Toit>OK,
what does our global network look like?</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/100-1
00:06:39.887 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Warren du Toit>Like that? It's a bit of spaghetti,
but what's cool about it is if you go to</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/100-2
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.594
<v Warren du Toit>submarincablemap.com,
you'll be able to see all of the Internet</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/100-3
00:06:51.594 --> 00:06:52.674
<v Warren du Toit>connectivity.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/104-0
00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:58.492
<v Warren du Toit>And all of the connectivity that
Microsoft has access to when we deliver</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/104-1
00:06:58.492 --> 00:07:04.410
<v Warren du Toit>our services to you. So it's a very,
very busy slide and you'll see that when</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/104-2
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.914
<v Warren du Toit>it comes to some of these things.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/108-0
00:07:07.914 --> 00:07:14.500
<v Warren du Toit>That's pretty much what ours looks like
out of that previous picture.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/108-1
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.333
<v Warren du Toit>We have more than 65 regions and at any
given moment in time,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/108-2
00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:22.874
<v Warren du Toit>I mean currently right now.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/112-0
00:07:23.914 --> 00:07:30.160
<v Warren du Toit>We probably have around 500 data center
projects around the world active and it</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/112-1
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.938
<v Warren du Toit>generally takes anywhere between three
and five years for one of those to</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/112-2
00:07:35.938 --> 00:07:40.154
<v Warren du Toit>complete. So it's actually it's,
it's a big business.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/117-0
00:07:40.234 --> 00:07:44.194
<v Warren du Toit>And in each one of those regions,
as you can imagine,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/117-1
00:07:44.194 --> 00:07:49.107
<v Warren du Toit>we have to deal with everything.
So from workers, unions, strikes,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/117-2
00:07:49.107 --> 00:07:53.507
<v Warren du Toit>delivery of concrete,
making sure that whatever we build is</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/117-3
00:07:53.507 --> 00:07:57.394
<v Warren du Toit>green, all that lovely stuff,
but we get through it.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/121-0
00:07:57.794 --> 00:08:02.278
<v Warren du Toit>There's over 320 data centers.
We have over 225 edge pops and we'll</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/121-1
00:08:02.278 --> 00:08:07.158
<v Warren du Toit>discuss what that means a little bit
later. Over 500,000 network devices.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/121-2
00:08:07.158 --> 00:08:10.851
<v Warren du Toit>Can you imagine managing over 500,
000 network devices?</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/121-3
00:08:10.851 --> 00:08:12.434
<v Warren du Toit>It's it's pretty insane.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/126-0
00:08:12.794 --> 00:08:21.263
<v Warren du Toit>And over 2 petabytes per second of WAN
capacity around the planet. We have 360,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/126-1
00:08:21.263 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Warren du Toit>000 kilometres of WAN fibre and we we
pretty much own that fibre,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/126-2
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.474
<v Warren du Toit>which is pretty cool.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/127-0
00:08:30.474 --> 00:08:33.658
<v Warren du Toit>Um,
if you look at how our data center design</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/127-1
00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:34.074
<v Warren du Toit>works.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/133-0
00:08:35.754 --> 00:08:42.857
<v Warren du Toit>You've got Earth, you've got regions,
and inside of those regions you'll have</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/133-1
00:08:42.857 --> 00:08:50.051
<v Warren du Toit>zones, and generally inside of a Geo,
which you could call a country inside of</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/133-2
00:08:50.051 --> 00:08:54.514
<v Warren du Toit>a Geo, we'll try to have two regions,
so you'll.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/137-0
00:08:55.594 --> 00:08:59.051
<v Warren du Toit>You'll see, like in South Africa,
we've got South Africa North,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/137-1
00:08:59.051 --> 00:09:02.833
<v Warren du Toit>we have South Africa West,
and as part of our new data center design,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/137-2
00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:07.263
<v Warren du Toit>we generally don't want to launch a data
center unless that data center has three</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/137-3
00:09:07.263 --> 00:09:09.802
<v Warren du Toit>zones.
South Africa W was launched before this</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/137-4
00:09:09.802 --> 00:09:12.557
<v Warren du Toit>happened,
so South Africa N is still considered as</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/137-5
00:09:12.557 --> 00:09:13.314
<v Warren du Toit>a single zone.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/139-0
00:09:13.674 --> 00:09:17.425
<v Warren du Toit>Even though there's actually more than
one data center and it's still considered</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/139-1
00:09:17.425 --> 00:09:18.074
<v Warren du Toit>a single zone.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/144-0
00:09:18.794 --> 00:09:24.249
<v Warren du Toit>You've got Azure zones,
and those zones will always be more than</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/144-1
00:09:24.249 --> 00:09:30.208
<v Warren du Toit>10 physical kilometers apart.
We don't specify how far apart they are,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/144-2
00:09:30.208 --> 00:09:36.839
<v Warren du Toit>but we generally do provide an SLA of
around two to three milliseconds between</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/144-3
00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:38.434
<v Warren du Toit>those zones, right?</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/148-0
00:09:38.714 --> 00:09:42.844
<v Warren du Toit>You how far apart they are,
security reasons, but you'll have AZ one,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/148-1
00:09:42.844 --> 00:09:45.735
<v Warren du Toit>AZ two,
AZ three and how we do load balancing of</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/148-2
00:09:45.735 --> 00:09:49.452
<v Warren du Toit>resources between that.
So you'll see we've got subscriptions,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/148-3
00:09:49.452 --> 00:09:54.114
<v Warren du Toit>the concept of a subscription inside of
Azure where you deploy your resources.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/152-0
00:09:54.314 --> 00:09:57.406
<v Warren du Toit>You'll find that when you're using a
subscription,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/152-1
00:09:57.406 --> 00:10:02.318
<v Warren du Toit>you'll have AZ1AZ2AZ3 physical locations,
and then another subscription might be</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/152-2
00:10:02.318 --> 00:10:06.320
<v Warren du Toit>AZ3AZ2AZ1 physical locations.
We'll actually mix and match those.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/152-3
00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.474
<v Warren du Toit>They won't actually be the same,
so subscription A.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/157-0
00:10:09.514 --> 00:10:13.249
<v Warren du Toit>AAZ one will not be the same as
subscription B's AZ one.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/157-1
00:10:13.249 --> 00:10:18.164
<v Warren du Toit>They could be different as far as
physical locations are concerned because</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/157-2
00:10:18.164 --> 00:10:21.310
<v Warren du Toit>we'll load balance the capacity as we go
along.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/157-3
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:26.684
<v Warren du Toit>Then each inside those Azure zones we can
have more than one physical data center</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/157-4
00:10:26.684 --> 00:10:27.274
<v Warren du Toit>per zone.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/162-0
00:10:28.154 --> 00:10:31.099
<v Warren du Toit>So in places like West Europe,
North Europe,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/162-1
00:10:31.099 --> 00:10:34.894
<v Warren du Toit>I mean some of those zones have like 6 or
7 data centers.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/162-2
00:10:34.894 --> 00:10:40.260
<v Warren du Toit>Inside the data centers we have stamps,
we have many stamps and each one of those</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/162-3
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:45.496
<v Warren du Toit>stamps will be custom built before we
deliver them to the data center and those</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/162-4
00:10:45.496 --> 00:10:45.954
<v Warren du Toit>stamps.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/167-0
00:10:46.074 --> 00:10:49.889
<v Warren du Toit>Will either be storage stamps or memory
optimized stamps,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/167-1
00:10:49.889 --> 00:10:55.019
<v Warren du Toit>compute optimized stamps, AI stamps,
and these change based on generation and</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/167-2
00:10:55.019 --> 00:11:00.018
<v Warren du Toit>they get more and more efficient every
time we deploy these and then inside</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/167-3
00:11:00.018 --> 00:11:01.794
<v Warren du Toit>those stamps we have racks.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/170-0
00:11:02.154 --> 00:11:06.946
<v Warren du Toit>And then those racks will then consist of
fault domains. And if you know your Azure,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/170-1
00:11:06.946 --> 00:11:10.048
<v Warren du Toit>you'll know that fault domains,
so that fault domains,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/170-2
00:11:10.048 --> 00:11:14.559
<v Warren du Toit>update domains will give you a certain
level of redundancy so that for instance</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/170-3
00:11:14.559 --> 00:11:16.194
<v Warren du Toit>if you've got update domains.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/175-0
00:11:17.274 --> 00:11:21.400
<v Warren du Toit>And we decide to patch hosts if you've
got your update domains configured</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/175-1
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.805
<v Warren du Toit>correctly. When we update those hosts,
your virtual machines won't be affected</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/175-2
00:11:25.805 --> 00:11:30.098
<v Warren du Toit>based on how you've configured that.
And this is one of the availability set</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/175-3
00:11:30.098 --> 00:11:33.332
<v Warren du Toit>concepts concepts,
but you can dig into that when we do a</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/175-4
00:11:33.332 --> 00:11:35.674
<v Warren du Toit>session on resiliency. Hint hint 99, Nick.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/176-0
00:11:36.274 --> 00:11:36.354
<v Warren du Toit>Um.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/181-0
00:11:38.314 --> 00:11:42.992
<v Warren du Toit>When we connect them. So you've got a,
we've got what we call RNGS,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/181-1
00:11:42.992 --> 00:11:48.015
<v Warren du Toit>which are regional network gateways and
those regional network gateways,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/181-2
00:11:48.015 --> 00:11:53.587
<v Warren du Toit>we generally have one per availability
zone and those regional network gateways,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/181-3
00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:55.514
<v Warren du Toit>nobody knows where they are.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/185-0
00:11:55.634 --> 00:11:59.452
<v Warren du Toit>It was just a week internally,
they don't even know where they are and</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/185-1
00:11:59.452 --> 00:12:02.733
<v Warren du Toit>they actually are separate to the actual
availability zones.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/185-2
00:12:02.733 --> 00:12:07.143
<v Warren du Toit>So you'll find that they're out of those
availability zones and we've got extreme</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/185-3
00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:10.908
<v Warren du Toit>amount of scaling in there.
So they can go from 100 gig to 200 gig to</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/185-4
00:12:10.908 --> 00:12:11.554
<v Warren du Toit>1.6 terabit.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/189-0
00:12:11.914 --> 00:12:16.729
<v Warren du Toit>Through any one of those RNGS at any
given time, the low latency,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/189-1
00:12:16.729 --> 00:12:21.835
<v Warren du Toit>anything sub one millisecond,
super high bandwidth and we have we use</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/189-2
00:12:21.835 --> 00:12:27.234
<v Warren du Toit>an we use a protocol called Sonic which
I'll dig into a little bit later.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/194-0
00:12:27.514 --> 00:12:32.253
<v Warren du Toit>And then we have our edge devices where
Internet peers will connect to.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/194-1
00:12:32.253 --> 00:12:37.387
<v Warren du Toit>So this would be maps or any other of the
sort of like Afrinic or Map Africa.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/194-2
00:12:37.387 --> 00:12:42.652
<v Warren du Toit>Those will connect through our edge and
then you'll have the private side which</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/194-3
00:12:42.652 --> 00:12:47.194
<v Warren du Toit>is Expressroute which connects directly
in the Via service provider.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/199-0
00:12:47.194 --> 00:12:53.083
<v Warren du Toit>Into our Azure routers and then that will
then route into those RNGS and that will</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/199-1
00:12:53.083 --> 00:12:58.049
<v Warren du Toit>then go into the Azure region.
We use software defined networking and</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/199-2
00:12:58.049 --> 00:13:02.378
<v Warren du Toit>they're controlled by an SWAN stack which
is based on Sonic,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/199-3
00:13:02.378 --> 00:13:05.074
<v Warren du Toit>which is open networking in the cloud.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/203-0
00:13:05.514 --> 00:13:10.596
<v Warren du Toit>And we've developed Sonic and we have a
whole bunch of partners that help us as</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/203-1
00:13:10.596 --> 00:13:13.455
<v Warren du Toit>well.
And you'll see it supports things like</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/203-2
00:13:13.455 --> 00:13:16.441
<v Warren du Toit>IPV 6.
We're actually supporting more and more</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/203-3
00:13:16.441 --> 00:13:21.714
<v Warren du Toit>IPV 6 as we go along and hopefully soon
it'll start becoming more of the standard.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/207-0
00:13:21.994 --> 00:13:26.628
<v Warren du Toit>So we've got a lot of active contributors
when it comes to Sonic,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/207-1
00:13:26.628 --> 00:13:31.613
<v Warren du Toit>and this is the stuff that we use for our
software defined networking.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/207-2
00:13:31.613 --> 00:13:36.177
<v Warren du Toit>So it's basically the Linux switch of
network operating systems.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/207-3
00:13:36.177 --> 00:13:38.354
<v Warren du Toit>How does LGO work specifically?</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/212-0
00:13:38.874 --> 00:13:42.826
<v Warren du Toit>As I mentioned before,
you'll see that we've got SA W,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/212-1
00:13:42.826 --> 00:13:48.574
<v Warren du Toit>we've got SA N. Inside the Africa Geo,
you'll see that we've got the RNGs there</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/212-2
00:13:48.574 --> 00:13:53.172
<v Warren du Toit>sitting in the middle.
Round trips between those RNGs and those</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/212-3
00:13:53.172 --> 00:13:58.274
<v Warren du Toit>DCs are sitting between one and two
milliseconds with an average of 1.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/217-0
00:13:58.554 --> 00:14:00.612
<v Warren du Toit>1.
6 petabyte per second of traffic</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/217-1
00:14:00.612 --> 00:14:03.585
<v Warren du Toit>available.
You'll see that 10 kilometer run between</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/217-2
00:14:03.585 --> 00:14:08.045
<v Warren du Toit>those and then you'll see that we've got
redundant DC's in each zone and then</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/217-3
00:14:08.045 --> 00:14:12.505
<v Warren du Toit>those are connected up together and then
they're connected to a ring and then</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/217-4
00:14:12.505 --> 00:14:16.850
<v Warren du Toit>those are then fired up to those RNG's
and then those RNG's then connect to</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/217-5
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:17.594
<v Warren du Toit>Global Azure.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/221-0
00:14:18.194 --> 00:14:24.086
<v Warren du Toit>You'll see that, for instance,
the round trip between South Africa West</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/221-1
00:14:24.086 --> 00:14:30.715
<v Warren du Toit>and South Africa N is generally around 36
milliseconds, 18 milliseconds one way,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/221-2
00:14:30.715 --> 00:14:32.434
<v Warren du Toit>reason being physics.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/223-0
00:14:33.394 --> 00:14:41.312
<v Warren du Toit>It's just very far away. I mean, you know,
speed of light over 1000 kilometers</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/223-1
00:14:41.312 --> 00:14:42.114
<v Warren du Toit>physics.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/225-0
00:14:43.114 --> 00:14:46.394
<v Warren du Toit>Azure networking some of the stuff that's
available to you.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/230-0
00:14:48.314 --> 00:14:53.162
<v Warren du Toit>As part of the Azure networking stack,
there's a lot. There really,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/230-1
00:14:53.162 --> 00:14:56.798
<v Warren du Toit>really is a lot.
We've got four different pillars.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/230-2
00:14:56.798 --> 00:15:00.434
<v Warren du Toit>So the deliver side, bottom right,
load balancers.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/230-3
00:15:00.434 --> 00:15:03.714
<v Warren du Toit>We've done a lot of work with load
balancers.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/234-0
00:15:04.554 --> 00:15:08.674
<v Warren du Toit>Our Azure load balancers as it stands
right now are zone redundant.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/234-1
00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:13.340
<v Warren du Toit>So when you deploy a load balancer,
you can deploy a load balancer and it'll</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/234-2
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.703
<v Warren du Toit>automatically be spanned across three
zones in a zone supported region.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/234-3
00:15:17.703 --> 00:15:20.794
<v Warren du Toit>So like in South African N deploy a load
balancer.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/239-0
00:15:21.114 --> 00:15:25.156
<v Warren du Toit>That load balancer will be spanned across
all three of those zones,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/239-1
00:15:25.156 --> 00:15:30.030
<v Warren du Toit>very similar with an application gateway
will do the same if you deploy it in the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/239-2
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:34.785
<v Warren du Toit>correct way. We've also got Front Door,
Traffic Manager, those sorts of things.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/239-3
00:15:34.785 --> 00:15:38.114
<v Warren du Toit>So Front Door are globally available WAF
unfortunately.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/244-0
00:15:38.394 --> 00:15:42.200
<v Warren du Toit>Had a bit of, as you say,
bad publicity in the past couple of weeks.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/244-1
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.627
<v Warren du Toit>It's unfortunate,
but sometimes it happens.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/244-2
00:15:44.627 --> 00:15:48.598
<v Warren du Toit>And then Front Door also consists of a
CDN, a content delivery network,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/244-3
00:15:48.598 --> 00:15:53.066
<v Warren du Toit>which is part of the Front Door service
which is there and then Traffic Manager,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/244-4
00:15:53.066 --> 00:15:57.314
<v Warren du Toit>which is just a globally distributed load
balancer, can work on DNS as well.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/248-0
00:15:57.514 --> 00:16:01.807
<v Warren du Toit>And then we've got the protect side of
things with DDOS protection on Vnets.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/248-1
00:16:01.807 --> 00:16:06.323
<v Warren du Toit>We've got our own version of Firewall,
which integrates a lot with our services.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/248-2
00:16:06.323 --> 00:16:09.891
<v Warren du Toit>So what's cool about the Azure Firewall,
it's things like VWAN,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/248-3
00:16:09.891 --> 00:16:11.954
<v Warren du Toit>which I'll get to a little bit later.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/253-0
00:16:14.194 --> 00:16:20.803
<v Warren du Toit>Azure Firewall can connect directly into
VWAN hub and it can protect the hub.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/253-1
00:16:20.803 --> 00:16:26.904
<v Warren du Toit>We've got network security groups which
allow you to protect your Vnet,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/253-2
00:16:26.904 --> 00:16:33.514
<v Warren du Toit>restrict incoming and outgoing traffic
port based as well and then we've got.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/257-0
00:16:33.514 --> 00:16:37.177
<v Warren du Toit>WAFs which are also part of the
Application Gateway and then Vnet</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/257-1
00:16:37.177 --> 00:16:41.229
<v Warren du Toit>endpoints which allow you to keep
everything private which connect up to</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/257-2
00:16:41.229 --> 00:16:45.170
<v Warren du Toit>platform as a service services.
And then we've got your stock standard</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/257-3
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.445
<v Warren du Toit>stuff on the left,
virtual networks which are same as VPCs</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/257-4
00:16:48.445 --> 00:16:48.834
<v Warren du Toit>in AWS.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/263-0
00:16:49.114 --> 00:16:53.362
<v Warren du Toit>We've got VPN gateways, VPN tunnels,
we've got DNS, we've got private DNS,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/263-1
00:16:53.362 --> 00:16:56.988
<v Warren du Toit>we've got public DNS.
Our DNS infrastructure is actually pretty</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/263-2
00:16:56.988 --> 00:17:00.613
<v Warren du Toit>incredible if you have to dig into the
architecture around DNS.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/263-3
00:17:00.613 --> 00:17:05.315
<v Warren du Toit>So something that happened to a WS couple
weeks ago would probably never happen to</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/263-4
00:17:05.315 --> 00:17:08.034
<v Warren du Toit>us because we learned our lesson the last
time.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/267-0
00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:12.990
<v Warren du Toit>So you'll see that we've actually got two
sets of redundant DNS resolvers that we</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/267-1
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:17.474
<v Warren du Toit>use globally. They're replicated globally.
We've actually got a Linux set and a</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/267-2
00:17:17.474 --> 00:17:21.902
<v Warren du Toit>window set that are completely redundant
and is completely replicated with one</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/267-3
00:17:21.902 --> 00:17:24.705
<v Warren du Toit>another.
So the chances of our DNS going down are</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/267-4
00:17:24.705 --> 00:17:25.994
<v Warren du Toit>very, very, very small.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/272-0
00:17:26.074 --> 00:17:29.409
<v Warren du Toit>Our Express Routes,
we've got a lot of different options</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/272-1
00:17:29.409 --> 00:17:32.042
<v Warren du Toit>there,
which I'll get to a little bit later.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/272-2
00:17:32.042 --> 00:17:36.371
<v Warren du Toit>We've got our VWAN hubs and again,
what would all of this be if we didn't</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/272-3
00:17:36.371 --> 00:17:40.467
<v Warren du Toit>monitor it? So we've got Azure Monitor,
Network Monitor, KX Monitors,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/272-4
00:17:40.467 --> 00:17:44.914
<v Warren du Toit>which I can take you through a little bit
later and again that GitHub repo.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/276-0
00:17:45.354 --> 00:17:50.652
<v Warren du Toit>Advances deployed will help you use that
to the best of your ability so that you</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/276-1
00:17:50.652 --> 00:17:54.577
<v Warren du Toit>can troubleshoot all of the stuff that
I've just mentioned.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/276-2
00:17:54.577 --> 00:17:59.744
<v Warren du Toit>We've made some really cool new updates
that are in preview which allow you to</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/276-3
00:17:59.744 --> 00:18:02.034
<v Warren du Toit>have the single pane of glass view.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/280-0
00:18:02.474 --> 00:18:06.392
<v Warren du Toit>Or your networking.
So we've got the hybrid connectivity pane</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/280-1
00:18:06.392 --> 00:18:08.667
<v Warren du Toit>now,
which allows you to check your</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/280-2
00:18:08.667 --> 00:18:12.333
<v Warren du Toit>Expressroute circuits,
any of your route filters for BGP,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/280-3
00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:15.999
<v Warren du Toit>some of your VPN gateways,
what your VWAN hubs look like,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/280-4
00:18:15.999 --> 00:18:18.274
<v Warren du Toit>and if you've got any route servers.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/285-0
00:18:18.754 --> 00:18:22.161
<v Warren du Toit>Active inside of your inside of your

00:18:22.161 --> 00:18:24.745
<v Warren du Toit>We've also got the network foundation
pane,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/285-2
00:18:24.745 --> 00:18:28.974
<v Warren du Toit>which gives you access to all of your
virtual networks, your DNS zones,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/285-3
00:18:28.974 --> 00:18:31.852
<v Warren du Toit>traffic managers,
any of your private endpoints,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/285-4
00:18:31.852 --> 00:18:35.377
<v Warren du Toit>any of your network interfaces attached
to any of your VMS,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/285-5
00:18:35.377 --> 00:18:38.314
<v Warren du Toit>your network security groups,
public IP business.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/290-0
00:18:38.474 --> 00:18:42.716
<v Warren du Toit>All that cool stuff as well.
We've also got the Network Security Pane,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/290-1
00:18:42.716 --> 00:18:45.525
<v Warren du Toit>which you can help admin your Azure
firewalls,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/290-2
00:18:45.525 --> 00:18:48.811
<v Warren du Toit>any of the policies that are in your
Firewall Manager,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/290-3
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:52.994
<v Warren du Toit>the DDoS protection on your Vnets,
your virtual hubs and your virtual</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/290-4
00:18:52.994 --> 00:18:55.862
<v Warren du Toit>networks.
So we're creating this single pane of</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/290-5
00:18:55.862 --> 00:18:57.954
<v Warren du Toit>glass view so that you can look at.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/294-0
00:18:58.354 --> 00:19:01.866
<v Warren du Toit>This from a bird's eye so that we've also
got something really cool.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/294-1
00:19:01.866 --> 00:19:04.207
<v Warren du Toit>It's a little bit later.
I'll show it to you.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/294-2
00:19:04.207 --> 00:19:07.413
<v Warren du Toit>We've got Azure Virtual Network Manager,
which is really cool.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/294-3
00:19:07.413 --> 00:19:10.976
<v Warren du Toit>It allows you to deploy different
policies down to all of your Vnets.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/294-4
00:19:10.976 --> 00:19:14.234
<v Warren du Toit>So if you're making a routing change,
it's actually quite cool.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/295-0
00:19:14.234 --> 00:19:14.354
<v Warren du Toit>Um.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/301-0
00:19:16.474 --> 00:19:19.833
<v Warren du Toit>We've got Storage Center now,
also single pane of glass view.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/301-1
00:19:19.833 --> 00:19:22.325
<v Warren du Toit>You'll see that we've also released this
new,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/301-2
00:19:22.325 --> 00:19:26.063
<v Warren du Toit>this new update called Storage Discovery,
which is also really cool,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/301-3
00:19:26.063 --> 00:19:30.343
<v Warren du Toit>which allows you to scan all of your
storage accounts and understand what your</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/301-4
00:19:30.343 --> 00:19:31.914
<v Warren du Toit>storage ecosystem looks like.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/305-0
00:19:32.234 --> 00:19:36.717
<v Warren du Toit>We can also manage your private
connectivity here for all of your storage</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/305-1
00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:39.868
<v Warren du Toit>accounts. I am.
I know I'm going a little bit fast,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/305-2
00:19:39.868 --> 00:19:43.745
<v Warren du Toit>but I've got a lot to get to.
Then we've got our cloud adoption</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/305-3
00:19:43.745 --> 00:19:44.594
<v Warren du Toit>framework and.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/310-0
00:19:46.954 --> 00:19:50.153
<v Warren du Toit>I know everybody's heard us beat this
drum,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/310-1
00:19:50.153 --> 00:19:53.934
<v Warren du Toit>but the Cloud Adoption Framework is very
important.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/310-2
00:19:53.934 --> 00:19:57.788
<v Warren du Toit>You can see that we've actually updated
it recently.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/310-3
00:19:57.788 --> 00:20:03.168
<v Warren du Toit>There's a couple of new extra blocks.
You'll see there's this AI Services</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/310-4
00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:04.114
<v Warren du Toit>subscription.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/315-0
00:20:04.394 --> 00:20:09.140
<v Warren du Toit>Down there at the bottom that we've also
got this next piece here and you'll see</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/315-1
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.304
<v Warren du Toit>sort of in the top.
I know it's it's it's grayed out,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/315-2
00:20:12.304 --> 00:20:16.230
<v Warren du Toit>but you'll see the top left.
We've got a security subscription now</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/315-3
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:20.858
<v Warren du Toit>which has been made standard and then
landing zones themselves have been split</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/315-4
00:20:20.858 --> 00:20:23.554
<v Warren du Toit>into a platform side and an application
side.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/319-0
00:20:23.594 --> 00:20:29.070
<v Warren du Toit>So that you can delineate between those,
but they can still become part of those</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/319-1
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:34.545
<v Warren du Toit>landing zone designs that you do up front.
So we've singled out the connectivity</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/319-2
00:20:34.545 --> 00:20:39.954
<v Warren du Toit>subscription here specifically because as
part of the cloud adoption framework.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/325-0
00:20:40.314 --> 00:20:43.642
<v Warren du Toit>In your regions, you can excuse me.
In your regions,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/325-1
00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:46.405
<v Warren du Toit>depending on the design that you've
chosen,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/325-2
00:20:46.405 --> 00:20:51.240
<v Warren du Toit>you can choose to automate this entire
process using infrastructure as code,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/325-3
00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:56.139
<v Warren du Toit>Terraform, Bicep, whatever you choose.
You can have your expression circuits,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/325-4
00:20:56.139 --> 00:20:58.274
<v Warren du Toit>your firewall policies, your NVAS.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/329-0
00:20:58.554 --> 00:21:03.499
<v Warren du Toit>Let's say you choose to use Palo Alto,
Fortinet, whatever the case may be.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/329-1
00:21:03.499 --> 00:21:07.852
<v Warren du Toit>You can deploy those inside of this using
infrastructure as code,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/329-2
00:21:07.852 --> 00:21:11.940
<v Warren du Toit>and again you can deploy them redundantly.
You can make them.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/329-3
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.754
<v Warren du Toit>You can do the role based access control
for all of your network admins.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/334-0
00:21:17.034 --> 00:21:20.593
<v Warren du Toit>You can make sure that the monitoring is
done and everything all via</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/334-1
00:21:20.593 --> 00:21:23.791
<v Warren du Toit>infrastructure as code based on the Cloud
Adoption Framework.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/334-2
00:21:23.791 --> 00:21:28.073
<v Warren du Toit>And we give you a lot of these templates
so that you can deploy these connectivity</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/334-3
00:21:28.073 --> 00:21:32.045
<v Warren du Toit>subscriptions relatively easy and the
policies that lie on top of them which</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/334-4
00:21:32.045 --> 00:21:33.954
<v Warren du Toit>would go into your management groups.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/338-0
00:21:34.274 --> 00:21:38.103
<v Warren du Toit>And in those management groups,
you then add your connectivity</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/338-1
00:21:38.103 --> 00:21:42.358
<v Warren du Toit>description into that so that all of
these policies will apply to the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/338-2
00:21:42.358 --> 00:21:45.580
<v Warren du Toit>subscription.
What does secure networking look like?</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/338-3
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.714
<v Warren du Toit>I added this in because this is quite
important with today because.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/342-0
00:21:50.074 --> 00:21:53.747
<v Warren du Toit>Everything's AI.
And what would life be without an AI</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/342-1
00:21:53.747 --> 00:21:57.352
<v Warren du Toit>landing zone?
What would life be without a secure AI</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/342-2
00:21:57.352 --> 00:22:00.412
<v Warren du Toit>landing zone?
So in this particular picture,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/342-3
00:22:00.412 --> 00:22:05.514
<v Warren du Toit>you'll see we've got our connectivity
subscription on the right hand side.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/347-0
00:22:06.394 --> 00:22:11.171
<v Warren du Toit>We've got our management groups that are
managing it and let's say we've connected</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/347-1
00:22:11.171 --> 00:22:13.819
<v Warren du Toit>up to on-prem.
We could even connect to a WS,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/347-2
00:22:13.819 --> 00:22:16.985
<v Warren du Toit>doesn't matter.
You'll see that we've then got a peer,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/347-3
00:22:16.985 --> 00:22:21.705
<v Warren du Toit>a virtual network and peered to another
network and inside that network we've got</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/347-4
00:22:21.705 --> 00:22:25.274
<v Warren du Toit>a landing zone which has been designed
for an AI application.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/350-0
00:22:26.074 --> 00:22:31.871
<v Warren du Toit>You'll see that there's a whole bunch of
private endpoints in the middle.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/350-1
00:22:31.871 --> 00:22:35.554
<v Warren du Toit>Reason being you'll see that we've got
whoops.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/355-0
00:22:38.794 --> 00:22:42.350
<v Warren du Toit>You'll see that we've got the dump box
over here.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/355-1
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:47.401
<v Warren du Toit>We've got a storage account which has got
private endpoint over there.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/355-2
00:22:47.401 --> 00:22:52.593
<v Warren du Toit>We've got AI Search with a private
endpoint, Cosmos DB private endpoint,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/355-3
00:22:52.593 --> 00:22:54.514
<v Warren du Toit>Key Vault private endpoint.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/357-0
00:22:54.994 --> 00:22:58.055
<v Warren du Toit>AI services.
So this could be something like Face API</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/357-1
00:22:58.055 --> 00:23:02.194
<v Warren du Toit>or whatever the case may be with private
endoints. We've got our models.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/361-0
00:23:03.594 --> 00:23:08.958
<v Warren du Toit>So anything like you could use Grok,
you could use 534, you could use GPT,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/361-1
00:23:08.958 --> 00:23:13.106
<v Warren du Toit>doesn't matter.
Any of the larger language models that we</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/361-2
00:23:13.106 --> 00:23:16.754
<v Warren du Toit>support,
you could then use on a private endpoint.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/362-0
00:23:19.194 --> 00:23:19.794
<v Warren du Toit>It's.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/367-0
00:23:21.034 --> 00:23:24.704
<v Warren du Toit>My mouse keeps doing that. OK,
then you'll see that we they can go into</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/367-1
00:23:24.704 --> 00:23:27.763
<v Warren du Toit>different subnets.
You can manage the routing between those</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/367-2
00:23:27.763 --> 00:23:30.364
<v Warren du Toit>subnets via NSGS.
Then you'll see that we've got a</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/367-3
00:23:30.364 --> 00:23:33.932
<v Warren du Toit>container app environment which is
actually managing the application.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/367-4
00:23:33.932 --> 00:23:37.603
<v Warren du Toit>So we'd be running microservices.
In this case it could be a Kubernetes</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/367-5
00:23:37.603 --> 00:23:38.674
<v Warren du Toit>cluster, it could be.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/372-0
00:23:39.394 --> 00:23:43.184
<v Warren du Toit>App services choice is yours.
We've got container registries,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/372-1
00:23:43.184 --> 00:23:47.402
<v Warren du Toit>we've got app configurations.
But the idea behind this is that every</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/372-2
00:23:47.402 --> 00:23:51.865
<v Warren du Toit>single one of these services is
communicating internally to the network.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/372-3
00:23:51.865 --> 00:23:56.755
<v Warren du Toit>So you've got this entire AI application
which is sitting behind an application</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/372-4
00:23:56.755 --> 00:23:58.834
<v Warren du Toit>gateway, behind a web application.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/375-0
00:23:59.114 --> 00:24:02.442
<v Warren du Toit>Firewall,
but all of the networking and all of the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/375-1
00:24:02.442 --> 00:24:07.794
<v Warren du Toit>private endoints has allowed you to keep
that entire application inside and safe.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/380-0
00:24:09.354 --> 00:24:15.029
<v Warren du Toit>So you can use as much AI as you want,
but it's never going to leave the network.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/380-1
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:20.150
<v Warren du Toit>Cool thing is as well is you can make
this entire architecture redundant.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/380-2
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:24.926
<v Warren du Toit>We can even have these foundry models
sitting behind an API manager,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/380-3
00:24:24.926 --> 00:24:28.594
<v Warren du Toit>so APIM API Gateway and those large
language models.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/384-0
00:24:29.274 --> 00:24:32.247
<v Warren du Toit>You could have one in Sweden if you
wanted to.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/384-1
00:24:32.247 --> 00:24:36.737
<v Warren du Toit>You could have your primary large
language model here in South Africa,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/384-2
00:24:36.737 --> 00:24:41.165
<v Warren du Toit>and then you could have a secondary one
in Sweden. And if, let's say,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/384-3
00:24:41.165 --> 00:24:44.834
<v Warren du Toit>the one in South Africa N had to die,
we could fail over.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/389-0
00:24:45.034 --> 00:24:48.761
<v Warren du Toit>Automatically to the ones in three so
that you wouldn't lose access to the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/389-1
00:24:48.761 --> 00:24:52.737
<v Warren du Toit>large language model and your application
wouldn't break and you could still do</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/389-2
00:24:52.737 --> 00:24:55.521
<v Warren du Toit>that privately.
It would just traverse our backbone via</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/389-3
00:24:55.521 --> 00:24:58.652
<v Warren du Toit>the private endpoint.
So there's a lot of options to make sure</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/389-4
00:24:58.652 --> 00:24:59.994
<v Warren du Toit>that this is redundant. OK.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/394-0
00:25:00.594 --> 00:25:05.064
<v Warren du Toit>When it comes to routing preference
inside of Azure,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/394-1
00:25:05.064 --> 00:25:10.546
<v Warren du Toit>so you'll see we've got hot potato
routing, cold potato routing.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/394-2
00:25:10.546 --> 00:25:16.787
<v Warren du Toit>So routing via our global network you'll
see from you it's the local ISP.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/394-3
00:25:16.787 --> 00:25:18.474
<v Warren du Toit>So if you route via.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/398-0
00:25:19.314 --> 00:25:23.659
<v Warren du Toit>The Microsoft Global Network,
let's say cold potato routing.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/398-1
00:25:23.659 --> 00:25:27.861
<v Warren du Toit>It's going to enter Microsoft network
closest to the user,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/398-2
00:25:27.861 --> 00:25:33.559
<v Warren du Toit>so it's going to stay on our backbone
until it exits closest to the router. OK,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/398-3
00:25:33.559 --> 00:25:35.554
<v Warren du Toit>so you can think of this as.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/399-0
00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:36.194
<v Warren du Toit>Um.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/405-0
00:25:37.994 --> 00:25:42.234
<v Warren du Toit>Office 365, Office 365,
it's going to hit us as quickly as it</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/405-1
00:25:42.234 --> 00:25:46.132
<v Warren du Toit>possibly can,
and then it's going to route inside of us,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/405-2
00:25:46.132 --> 00:25:50.235
<v Warren du Toit>inside of our network,
it's going to access the services it</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/405-3
00:25:50.235 --> 00:25:52.834
<v Warren du Toit>needs to, and then it's going to exit.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/409-0
00:25:53.794 --> 00:25:57.862
<v Warren du Toit>So you'll see it's the default network
for all of our networking services, right?</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/409-1
00:25:57.862 --> 00:26:00.839
<v Warren du Toit>Then we've got hot potato routing,
which is cost optimized.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/409-2
00:26:00.839 --> 00:26:04.114
<v Warren du Toit>It's going to route via the Internet,
which means it's up to you.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/409-3
00:26:04.114 --> 00:26:08.034
<v Warren du Toit>It's going to enter the Microsoft region
closest to the hosted service region.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/412-0
00:26:08.314 --> 00:26:12.347
<v Warren du Toit>And then it's going to exit Microsoft in
the same region the service is hosted.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/412-1
00:26:12.347 --> 00:26:15.725
<v Warren du Toit>So even though it's cost optimized,
it's not exactly the greatest.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/412-2
00:26:15.725 --> 00:26:19.154
<v Warren du Toit>So you'll see that there's some
descriptions around how that works.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/415-0
00:26:20.514 --> 00:26:25.009
<v Warren du Toit>Then connecting to Azure,
we've got the Internet,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/415-1
00:26:25.009 --> 00:26:29.234
<v Warren du Toit>so Internet facing stuff,
public IP addresses.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/420-0
00:26:30.794 --> 00:26:35.278
<v Warren du Toit>Stuff that's sitting on the edge of Azure.
So we would have a public IP address.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/420-1
00:26:35.278 --> 00:26:39.542
<v Warren du Toit>You could attach that to a firewall,
you could attach that to an application</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/420-2
00:26:39.542 --> 00:26:42.144
<v Warren du Toit>gateway,
and then everybody would just use the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/420-3
00:26:42.144 --> 00:26:46.352
<v Warren du Toit>Internet wherever they are to hit the
cloud. Then you've got remote access,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/420-4
00:26:46.352 --> 00:26:48.954
<v Warren du Toit>which is point to site where you've got a
VPN.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/425-0
00:26:49.354 --> 00:26:53.586
<v Warren du Toit>So Mac, Linux, Windows Phone,
you could use AD authentication,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/425-1
00:26:53.586 --> 00:26:57.415
<v Warren du Toit>you could use Radius.
They essentially use a VPN client,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/425-2
00:26:57.415 --> 00:27:02.185
<v Warren du Toit>they remote into Azure and they can be on
the network inside of Azure.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/425-3
00:27:02.185 --> 00:27:06.148
<v Warren du Toit>Then you go site to site.
Site to site is when you've got,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/425-4
00:27:06.148 --> 00:27:08.634
<v Warren du Toit>let's say a firewall or a VPN device.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/430-0
00:27:09.274 --> 00:27:14.280
<v Warren du Toit>On premises and it establishes an IPsec
tunnel into Azure. You could use BGP,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/430-1
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.452
<v Warren du Toit>you could add active, active,
you could do transit routing here.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/430-2
00:27:18.452 --> 00:27:22.945
<v Warren du Toit>This is high throughput again.
You could also use something like ECMP</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/430-3
00:27:22.945 --> 00:27:28.144
<v Warren du Toit>where it load balances across multiple
tunnels because you've got limitations on</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/430-4
00:27:28.144 --> 00:27:28.594
<v Warren du Toit>the IP.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/433-0
00:27:28.994 --> 00:27:33.566
<v Warren du Toit>the protocol, so IKE.
Then you could load balance across</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/433-1
00:27:33.566 --> 00:27:39.020
<v Warren du Toit>multiple VPN tunnels if you wanted to,
and increase the throughput.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/433-2
00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:44.394
<v Warren du Toit>Then finally we've got ExpressRoute.
In ExpressRoute, you could...</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/438-0
00:27:44.554 --> 00:27:48.345
<v Warren du Toit>By default, not encrypted,
which I'll get to a little bit later.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/438-1
00:27:48.345 --> 00:27:51.845
<v Warren du Toit>You could run an IP6 tunnel over that to
make it encrypted,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/438-2
00:27:51.845 --> 00:27:56.044
<v Warren du Toit>but ideally that's private connectivity.
So you would want to run this.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/438-3
00:27:56.044 --> 00:28:00.594
<v Warren du Toit>You've got anything from I think 50 Meg
all the way up to I think if we take.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/442-0
00:28:01.034 --> 00:28:06.924
<v Warren du Toit>Express direct in this country,
I think goes up to 40 gig per second now.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/442-1
00:28:06.924 --> 00:28:11.541
<v Warren du Toit>I think it was just. Oh no, wait,
it's 100. It's 100 now.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/442-2
00:28:11.541 --> 00:28:17.114
<v Warren du Toit>I think it's 100 now. Um, Express,
Express route will get to 100. Um.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/447-0
00:28:17.314 --> 00:28:22.745
<v Warren du Toit>As far as speeds are concerned,
providing the switching and the service</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/447-1
00:28:22.745 --> 00:28:27.120
<v Warren du Toit>provider supports it.
Then inside of Azure we've got Vnet</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/447-2
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.967
<v Warren du Toit>peering,
you've got Vnet to Vnet gateways and then</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/447-3
00:28:30.967 --> 00:28:35.116
<v Warren du Toit>private link.
Private link is cool because it can also</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/447-4
00:28:35.116 --> 00:28:36.474
<v Warren du Toit>work cross region.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/451-0
00:28:37.034 --> 00:28:42.419
<v Warren du Toit>Like I said about the AI thing,
but it can also work cross tenant.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/451-1
00:28:42.419 --> 00:28:48.768
<v Warren du Toit>So for instance if you let's say you've
got a hosted service from someone like</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/451-2
00:28:48.768 --> 00:28:52.707
<v Warren du Toit>Mongo DB.
So Mongo DB has a service called Atlas</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/451-3
00:28:52.707 --> 00:28:54.234
<v Warren du Toit>where they spin up.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/456-0
00:28:54.714 --> 00:28:59.029
<v Warren du Toit>A database service inside of their tenant
which they manage,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/456-1
00:28:59.029 --> 00:29:04.688
<v Warren du Toit>but then they will give you a private
link and that private link will be inside</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/456-2
00:29:04.688 --> 00:29:10.560
<v Warren du Toit>your subscription inside your tenant and
you'll have an IP address locally in your</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/456-3
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:10.914
<v Warren du Toit>Vnet.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/460-0
00:29:11.194 --> 00:29:14.520
<v Warren du Toit>But then using our software defined
networking,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/460-1
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:19.579
<v Warren du Toit>you're then connected to their tenant
privately to the service that they</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/460-2
00:29:19.579 --> 00:29:24.569
<v Warren du Toit>provide. We've got Azure VWAN,
which is our software defined networking</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/460-3
00:29:24.569 --> 00:29:29.074
<v Warren du Toit>for WANS, which is branch to Vnet,
Vnet to branch, Vnet to Vnet.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/465-0
00:29:29.514 --> 00:29:34.754
<v Warren du Toit>We can do VPN, we can do Expressroute,
and then we've got Expressroute Global</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/465-1
00:29:34.754 --> 00:29:37.911
<v Warren du Toit>Reach.
Global Reach is great because what that</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/465-2
00:29:37.911 --> 00:29:43.352
<v Warren du Toit>allows us to do is it allows you to have
DC to DC connectivity via our backbone.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/465-3
00:29:43.352 --> 00:29:47.047
<v Warren du Toit>So for instance,
if you've got an Expressroute circuit</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/465-4
00:29:47.047 --> 00:29:48.794
<v Warren du Toit>here in South Africa, you.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/469-0
00:29:49.274 --> 00:29:53.589
<v Warren du Toit>Connect to our data centers,
but then you've got an express route in</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/469-1
00:29:53.589 --> 00:29:56.341
<v Warren du Toit>the UK and you connect to our data
centers.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/469-2
00:29:56.341 --> 00:29:59.406
<v Warren du Toit>We can allow you connectivity from South
Africa,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/469-3
00:29:59.406 --> 00:30:04.034
<v Warren du Toit>your South Africa branch or DC to your UK
branch or DC over our backbone.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/473-0
00:30:04.234 --> 00:30:08.789
<v Warren du Toit>So it'll take the Expressroute from this
side and connect it to the Expressroute</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/473-1
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:13.288
<v Warren du Toit>on that side and you can route over our
backbone as opposed to paying a service</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/473-2
00:30:13.288 --> 00:30:17.394
<v Warren du Toit>provider for a link or for an MPLS link
that traverses the entire world.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/474-0
00:30:18.474 --> 00:30:19.874
<v Warren du Toit>Then it's apologies.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/479-0
00:30:21.754 --> 00:30:25.050
<v Warren du Toit>We've got AVM,
so Azure Virtual Network Manager,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/479-1
00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:29.222
<v Warren du Toit>which is like I said,
it was just recently released where you</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/479-2
00:30:29.222 --> 00:30:33.999
<v Warren du Toit>can define certain topologies
automatically where you can say I've got</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/479-3
00:30:33.999 --> 00:30:37.834
<v Warren du Toit>a hub spoke model,
you can define which one is your hub,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/479-4
00:30:37.834 --> 00:30:39.314
<v Warren du Toit>which are your spokes.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/484-0
00:30:39.354 --> 00:30:43.873
<v Warren du Toit>Then it will go automatically and create
those routing definitions for you and</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/484-1
00:30:43.873 --> 00:30:48.279
<v Warren du Toit>then make sure that it applies all of
those policies and effective routes to</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/484-2
00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:51.998
<v Warren du Toit>all of those different Vnets inside the
ones that you've chosen.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/484-3
00:30:51.998 --> 00:30:56.746
<v Warren du Toit>Or you could have mesh or you could have
hubspoke with direct connectivity between</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/484-4
00:30:56.746 --> 00:30:58.234
<v Warren du Toit>the spokes. So if there's.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/489-0
00:30:59.194 --> 00:31:02.085
<v Warren du Toit>Ever a case where you need two spokes to
talk to each other,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/489-1
00:31:02.085 --> 00:31:05.925
<v Warren du Toit>let's say you're trying to minimize cost
or you're trying to decrease latency or</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/489-2
00:31:05.925 --> 00:31:09.006
<v Warren du Toit>you don't want it to necessarily go
through the hub or firewall.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/489-3
00:31:09.006 --> 00:31:12.561
<v Warren du Toit>Let's say it's a high intensity data
workload or whatever the case may be,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/489-4
00:31:12.561 --> 00:31:13.794
<v Warren du Toit>you could do that as well.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/494-0
00:31:14.714 --> 00:31:19.922
<v Warren du Toit>Connecting to some of the Azure services
when it comes to the IaaS, PaaS,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/494-1
00:31:19.922 --> 00:31:23.723
<v Warren du Toit>SaaS workloads.
So we've got the Expressroute private</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/494-2
00:31:23.723 --> 00:31:29.284
<v Warren du Toit>peering where you can connect to IaaS,
we've got site to site or alternatively</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/494-3
00:31:29.284 --> 00:31:34.634
<v Warren du Toit>you can then do Microsoft public peering
where you can connect to platform.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/499-0
00:31:34.714 --> 00:31:39.214
<v Warren du Toit>As a services as well.
Then you'll see that we've got site to</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/499-1
00:31:39.214 --> 00:31:45.094
<v Warren du Toit>site VPN as well connecting to a branch.
We can also connect via Expressroute to</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/499-2
00:31:45.094 --> 00:31:48.506
<v Warren du Toit>IaaS from a branch as well.
You could do Paas.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/499-3
00:31:48.506 --> 00:31:53.878
<v Warren du Toit>I'm gonna just do the rest there.
So ideally you could connect any one of</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/499-4
00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:54.314
<v Warren du Toit>these.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/503-0
00:31:54.314 --> 00:31:58.678
<v Warren du Toit>Ways to Azure services and you'll see
that there's maps there at the end,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/503-1
00:31:58.678 --> 00:32:03.041
<v Warren du Toit>which I'll explain towards the end.
So there's a whole bunch of different</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/503-2
00:32:03.041 --> 00:32:06.874
<v Warren du Toit>ways that you can connect to each one of
the different services,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/503-3
00:32:06.874 --> 00:32:10.354
<v Warren du Toit>and ideally there's a more optimal way to
connect to them.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/507-0
00:32:10.794 --> 00:32:15.654
<v Warren du Toit>But at the same token,
you've got to understand what the costs</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/507-1
00:32:15.654 --> 00:32:20.977
<v Warren du Toit>for each one of these are.
Also performance versus security as well.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/507-2
00:32:20.977 --> 00:32:26.454
<v Warren du Toit>So there'll always be trade-offs
depending on which one it is that you</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/507-3
00:32:26.454 --> 00:32:26.994
<v Warren du Toit>choose.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/510-0
00:32:27.434 --> 00:32:31.227
<v Warren du Toit>And between performance,
cost and security. So just be careful,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/510-1
00:32:31.227 --> 00:32:35.554
<v Warren du Toit>take that into account whenever you're
designing network infrastructure.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/515-0
00:32:37.034 --> 00:32:42.814
<v Warren du Toit>Expressroute. So like I said before,
you're creating a private connection</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/515-1
00:32:42.814 --> 00:32:47.033
<v Warren du Toit>between our data centers and yours.
How does it work?</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/515-2
00:32:47.033 --> 00:32:52.189
<v Warren du Toit>So it supports route filters.
We've got resiliency because you'll</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/515-3
00:32:52.189 --> 00:32:56.954
<v Warren du Toit>always have a primary connection and a
secondary connection.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/519-0
00:32:57.034 --> 00:33:01.177
<v Warren du Toit>Whoops, it's layer 3 connectivity. OK,
like I said before,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/519-1
00:33:01.177 --> 00:33:05.953
<v Warren du Toit>it also allows you to connect not just to
Microsoft Cloud services,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/519-2
00:33:05.953 --> 00:33:10.588
<v Warren du Toit>but you can use Global Reach so that you
can connect to your DCS.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/519-3
00:33:10.588 --> 00:33:12.274
<v Warren du Toit>There's dynamic routing.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/523-0
00:33:13.034 --> 00:33:16.591
<v Warren du Toit>Via BGP,
it also supports quality of service and</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/523-1
00:33:16.591 --> 00:33:20.076
<v Warren du Toit>again we do have connection uptime SLS as
well.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/523-2
00:33:20.076 --> 00:33:26.029
<v Warren du Toit>So it'll do private connectivity as well
as platform as a service connectivity as</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/523-3
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:29.514
<v Warren du Toit>far as Microsoft online services are
concerned.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/527-0
00:33:29.634 --> 00:33:34.310
<v Warren du Toit>This has changed somewhat.
You can't do things like Office 365</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/527-1
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:39.952
<v Warren du Toit>unless you get special clearance.
The recommendation is to use maps instead</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/527-2
00:33:39.952 --> 00:33:45.074
<v Warren du Toit>when it comes to Express Route Direct.
Express Route Direct is when.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/531-0
00:33:45.434 --> 00:33:49.717
<v Warren du Toit>You in some ways become a provider.
So for instance,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/531-1
00:33:49.717 --> 00:33:55.779
<v Warren du Toit>if you're the IT department and you're
supplying connectivity to different</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/531-2
00:33:55.779 --> 00:34:01.114
<v Warren du Toit>business units inside of the organization,
what we'd be doing is.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/536-0
00:34:01.914 --> 00:34:05.883
<v Warren du Toit>You could have these Express Route Direct
dedicated ports,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/536-1
00:34:05.883 --> 00:34:10.660
<v Warren du Toit>so let's say 10 gig or 100 gig.
And then what you can do is then carve</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/536-2
00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:15.975
<v Warren du Toit>these 10 gig circuits or 100 gig circuits
up as much as you wanted in specific</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/536-3
00:34:15.975 --> 00:34:19.474
<v Warren du Toit>speeds. So you could either, let's say,
use a 5221.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/541-0
00:34:19.994 --> 00:34:24.353
<v Warren du Toit>For the 10 or you could do 222222 or you
could just do the single 10.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/541-1
00:34:24.353 --> 00:34:28.962
<v Warren du Toit>The idea behind this is that you can
attach each one of these circuits to</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/541-2
00:34:28.962 --> 00:34:33.944
<v Warren du Toit>different virtual networks for different
BU's and then you won't get this noisy</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/541-3
00:34:33.944 --> 00:34:39.114
<v Warren du Toit>neighbor type vibe where one is going to
overtake from the other or alternatively.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/546-0
00:34:39.834 --> 00:34:43.545
<v Warren du Toit>We've had it in situations where
customers have decided they'll take an</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/546-1
00:34:43.545 --> 00:34:47.669
<v Warren du Toit>Express Route direct because they want to
do a large scale migration of virtual</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/546-2
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:50.761
<v Warren du Toit>machines. They'll go,
they'll get the the 210 gig circuits,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/546-3
00:34:50.761 --> 00:34:53.442
<v Warren du Toit>the primary, secondary,
they'll bond them together.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/546-4
00:34:53.442 --> 00:34:57.514
<v Warren du Toit>They'll have 20 gigs of throughput and
they'll just smash as much as they can.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/547-0
00:34:57.834 --> 00:34:57.914
<v Warren du Toit>Um.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/553-0
00:35:00.874 --> 00:35:03.703
<v Warren du Toit>Then you've got local,
Express Route Local,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/553-1
00:35:03.703 --> 00:35:07.432
<v Warren du Toit>you've got Express Route Standard,
Express Route Premium.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/553-2
00:35:07.432 --> 00:35:11.032
<v Warren du Toit>There are differences.
Express Route Local is obviously</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/553-3
00:35:11.032 --> 00:35:13.990
<v Warren du Toit>unlimited when it comes to egress,
but again,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/553-4
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:19.134
<v Warren du Toit>you'll only be able to contact SA N if
you're within the SA N Metro and SA W if</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/553-5
00:35:19.134 --> 00:35:20.034
<v Warren du Toit>you're in the.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/555-0
00:35:20.554 --> 00:35:24.454
<v Warren du Toit>In the in sort of the Cape Town metro,
then you've got standard,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/555-1
00:35:24.454 --> 00:35:28.474
<v Warren du Toit>which is either unlimited or metered,
and then you've got premium,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/555-2
00:35:28.474 --> 00:35:31.594
<v Warren du Toit>which then allows you to do the global
reach thing.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/560-0
00:35:32.874 --> 00:35:37.604
<v Warren du Toit>The connectivity models,
I'm going to skip that one to go through</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/560-1
00:35:37.604 --> 00:35:41.904
<v Warren du Toit>here. Express direct.
I want to take the Max SEC thing into</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/560-2
00:35:41.904 --> 00:35:47.637
<v Warren du Toit>consideration quickly. So with Max SEC,
you've got layer 2 encryption where you</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/560-3
00:35:47.637 --> 00:35:50.074
<v Warren du Toit>as the customer would own the key.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/565-0
00:35:50.674 --> 00:35:55.559
<v Warren du Toit>You can oversubscribe slightly by
creating additional circuits,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/565-1
00:35:55.559 --> 00:36:00.674
<v Warren du Toit>and because of the Max Sick,
it means that anything inside of that</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/565-2
00:36:00.674 --> 00:36:04.948
<v Warren du Toit>particular layer two would be encrypted
from the start,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/565-3
00:36:04.948 --> 00:36:09.834
<v Warren du Toit>and as a result you don't actually need
to apply encryption on.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/566-0
00:36:09.874 --> 00:36:11.234
<v Warren du Toit>The the link so.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/572-0
00:36:13.754 --> 00:36:17.598
<v Warren du Toit>Certain financial services customers or
compliant customers don't have to apply</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/572-1
00:36:17.598 --> 00:36:20.673
<v Warren du Toit>additional encryption.
So you'll see that there's a letter that</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/572-2
00:36:20.673 --> 00:36:23.507
<v Warren du Toit>you have to sign.
There's a whole bunch of cool stuff that</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/572-3
00:36:23.507 --> 00:36:26.102
<v Warren du Toit>has to happen there for you to get
Express to Direct.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/572-4
00:36:26.102 --> 00:36:29.754
<v Warren du Toit>We've got a couple of customers in South
Africa that have it, mostly banks.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/576-0
00:36:30.514 --> 00:36:33.599
<v Warren du Toit>Then you'll see that we've also got 802.
1Q,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/576-1
00:36:33.599 --> 00:36:37.165
<v Warren du Toit>so you can carry multiple Vlans over a
single wire.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/576-2
00:36:37.165 --> 00:36:42.651
<v Warren du Toit>So you can also do double tagging as well
where Vlans in the trunk can overlap.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/576-3
00:36:42.651 --> 00:36:45.394
<v Warren du Toit>So you can have an outer tag, inner tag.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/579-0
00:36:45.914 --> 00:36:52.446
<v Warren du Toit>So private peering and Microsoft peering
in the different Vlans,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/579-1
00:36:52.446 --> 00:36:57.874
<v Warren du Toit>which is also quite cool.
IPsec over Expressroute is.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/584-0
00:37:00.234 --> 00:37:04.807
<v Warren du Toit>The way that certain customers,
if they can't afford Express Route Direct,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/584-1
00:37:04.807 --> 00:37:08.892
<v Warren du Toit>they will encrypt over Express Route so
that they'll be compliant.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/584-2
00:37:08.892 --> 00:37:13.709
<v Warren du Toit>And for links generally smaller than a
gig, they can do that too site to site,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/584-3
00:37:13.709 --> 00:37:15.234
<v Warren du Toit>which I explained before.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/588-0
00:37:16.314 --> 00:37:22.312
<v Warren du Toit>Max bandwidth speed is 2.5 at the moment.
If you use the correct settings for the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/588-1
00:37:22.312 --> 00:37:26.263
<v Warren du Toit>IKE protocol,
generally the limitation is around 1.4,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/588-2
00:37:26.263 --> 00:37:31.895
<v Warren du Toit>but we've been able to push it with our
new gateways so it connects over the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/588-3
00:37:31.895 --> 00:37:32.554
<v Warren du Toit>Internet.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/590-0
00:37:32.954 --> 00:37:40.794
<v Warren du Toit>Yeah, non-mission critical workloads.
It uses RKE RP SEC. Then we have VWAN.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/592-0
00:37:43.074 --> 00:37:43.234
<v Warren du Toit>Um.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/598-0
00:37:46.554 --> 00:37:51.493
<v Warren du Toit>We've got a bunch of partners when it
comes to the VWAN ecosystem.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/598-1
00:37:51.493 --> 00:37:55.989
<v Warren du Toit>This is around security and integration
into VWAN using NVA,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/598-2
00:37:55.989 --> 00:38:01.223
<v Warren du Toit>so network virtual appliances.
So we've got Fortinet for instance will</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/598-3
00:38:01.223 --> 00:38:05.130
<v Warren du Toit>integrate,
they'll deploy network virtual appliances</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/598-4
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:05.794
<v Warren du Toit>directly.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/602-0
00:38:06.194 --> 00:38:12.592
<v Warren du Toit>Directly into the VWAN hub and it will be
able to then secure all the traffic that</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/602-1
00:38:12.592 --> 00:38:18.990
<v Warren du Toit>goes in and out. Things like Palo Alto.
Unfortunately it's not necessarily an NVA,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/602-2
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:20.994
<v Warren du Toit>it's more a cloud service.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/607-0
00:38:21.354 --> 00:38:26.151
<v Warren du Toit>So it's like a software as a service
firewall which sort of sits outside the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/607-1
00:38:26.151 --> 00:38:29.391
<v Warren du Toit>view end,
but we route the information out the view</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/607-2
00:38:29.391 --> 00:38:33.379
<v Warren du Toit>end into their cloud service and and back
out it. I mean, look,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/607-3
00:38:33.379 --> 00:38:36.308
<v Warren du Toit>the latency's not not anything to worry
about,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/607-4
00:38:36.308 --> 00:38:40.794
<v Warren du Toit>it's just it's not an actual virtual
machine sitting within the tenant.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/611-0
00:38:41.234 --> 00:38:45.934
<v Warren du Toit>So it can scale. It's great.
It's actually a pretty rad service,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/611-1
00:38:45.934 --> 00:38:51.357
<v Warren du Toit>but it's how they got around not having
to custom design a network virtual</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/611-2
00:38:51.357 --> 00:38:57.286
<v Warren du Toit>appliance that goes into our into our hub.
Checkpoint has something inside of the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/611-3
00:38:57.286 --> 00:38:58.154
<v Warren du Toit>hub as well.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/615-0
00:38:58.234 --> 00:39:02.035
<v Warren du Toit>So you've got you've got options when
you're deploying a hub.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/615-1
00:39:02.035 --> 00:39:06.449
<v Warren du Toit>The great thing about this is that it
integrates directly into the hub,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/615-2
00:39:06.449 --> 00:39:11.293
<v Warren du Toit>so you don't have to worry about all the
complex routing and all that stuff as</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/615-3
00:39:11.293 --> 00:39:13.194
<v Warren du Toit>well when it comes to the Vnet.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/620-0
00:39:13.674 --> 00:39:17.474
<v Warren du Toit>VWAN hub in a single region looks
something like this.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/620-1
00:39:17.474 --> 00:39:21.757
<v Warren du Toit>You'll have a VWAN hub in the region like
South Africa North,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/620-2
00:39:21.757 --> 00:39:26.110
<v Warren du Toit>and you'll have a bunch of Vnets
connecting into the VWAN hub.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/620-3
00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:30.325
<v Warren du Toit>You can then have the VPN gateways
sitting inside that VWAN.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/620-4
00:39:30.325 --> 00:39:33.434
<v Warren du Toit>You can then scale those VPN gateways
using.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/624-0
00:39:33.514 --> 00:39:36.573
<v Warren du Toit>Scale units depending on the amount of
bandwidth you need,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/624-1
00:39:36.573 --> 00:39:39.165
<v Warren du Toit>and then they can then do point to site
to users,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/624-2
00:39:39.165 --> 00:39:43.365
<v Warren du Toit>or they can do site to site to branches,
or you can have an Expressroute gateway</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/624-3
00:39:43.365 --> 00:39:47.357
<v Warren du Toit>sitting inside of that vran as well,
and it'll pretty much manage all of the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/624-4
00:39:47.357 --> 00:39:49.794
<v Warren du Toit>routing between all of those different
pieces.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/629-0
00:39:50.154 --> 00:39:54.093
<v Warren du Toit>We've also got multi-region.
If you're doing multi-region,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/629-1
00:39:54.093 --> 00:39:57.098
<v Warren du Toit>you are going to want to deploy 2 VWAN
hubs.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/629-2
00:39:57.098 --> 00:40:02.306
<v Warren du Toit>So you'll have a VWAN hub in South Africa
North and VWAN hub in let's say UAE</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/629-3
00:40:02.306 --> 00:40:07.514
<v Warren du Toit>central or whatever the case may be is
and then those hub to hub connections.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/633-0
00:40:08.714 --> 00:40:12.227
<v Warren du Toit>We'll manage the routing between those
two regions,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/633-1
00:40:12.227 --> 00:40:17.497
<v Warren du Toit>and then the Vnet attached to those
regions will then be routed the same way,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/633-2
00:40:17.497 --> 00:40:21.754
<v Warren du Toit>but we'd manage the connectivity between
the regions that way.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/633-3
00:40:21.754 --> 00:40:23.714
<v Warren du Toit>So how does it actually work?</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/638-0
00:40:24.154 --> 00:40:27.607
<v Warren du Toit>You'll see that we've got a Virtual Hub
router.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/638-1
00:40:27.607 --> 00:40:32.427
<v Warren du Toit>It controls the routes between all the
gateways. As I said before,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/638-2
00:40:32.427 --> 00:40:36.672
<v Warren du Toit>you'll have an MVA integrated into the
Virtual Hub router.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/638-3
00:40:36.672 --> 00:40:42.211
<v Warren du Toit>You'll see there there's a Fortinet.
You have the option to have an indirect</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/638-4
00:40:42.211 --> 00:40:43.794
<v Warren du Toit>Vnet if you wanted to.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/643-0
00:40:43.834 --> 00:40:50.593
<v Warren du Toit>So if let's say there's an NVA that isn't
supported inside of the Vnet hub or the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/643-1
00:40:50.593 --> 00:40:54.715
<v Warren du Toit>VWAN hub,
you could create an indirect Vnet which</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/643-2
00:40:54.715 --> 00:40:58.754
<v Warren du Toit>could let's say handle your north-south
traffic.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/643-3
00:40:58.754 --> 00:41:02.794
<v Warren du Toit>So it could be like an egress firewall
and then.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/649-0
00:41:03.434 --> 00:41:08.030
<v Warren du Toit>You'd have, let's say,
an Azure firewall on the inside which</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/649-1
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:12.702
<v Warren du Toit>does your east West traffic.
So you can have a combination of</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/649-2
00:41:12.702 --> 00:41:18.354
<v Warren du Toit>different firewalls which we do often see
in financial services customers.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/653-0
00:41:18.794 --> 00:41:22.878
<v Warren du Toit>You'll see down at the bottom there's the
software as a service for Palo Alto.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/653-1
00:41:22.878 --> 00:41:25.773
<v Warren du Toit>So there's a bunch of different ways you
could do this.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/653-2
00:41:25.773 --> 00:41:30.013
<v Warren du Toit>We generally do see two sets of firewalls,
so you'll have one inside of the VWAN,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/653-3
00:41:30.013 --> 00:41:33.994
<v Warren du Toit>and then you'll have one outside of the
VWAN, which then manages the egress.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/657-0
00:41:34.234 --> 00:41:38.541
<v Warren du Toit>So like let's say there's a bunch of IP
addresses sitting on the outside of the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/657-1
00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:41.072
<v Warren du Toit>network,
they get inspected by the forty gates</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/657-2
00:41:41.072 --> 00:41:45.218
<v Warren du Toit>that then sends it into the VWAN hub,
the VWAN hub will distribute it to the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/657-3
00:41:45.218 --> 00:41:47.857
<v Warren du Toit>application service or whatever the case
may be.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/657-4
00:41:47.857 --> 00:41:51.895
<v Warren du Toit>So that's what that would look like there
when it comes to the resiliency,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/657-5
00:41:51.895 --> 00:41:52.434
<v Warren du Toit>excuse me.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/659-0
00:41:54.234 --> 00:41:56.954
<v Warren du Toit>Resiliency for Express route.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/663-0
00:41:58.314 --> 00:42:03.078
<v Warren du Toit>Currently in South Africa,
for at least next couple months,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/663-1
00:42:03.078 --> 00:42:06.889
<v Warren du Toit>we only have one edge location,
soon to be two,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/663-2
00:42:06.889 --> 00:42:13.002
<v Warren du Toit>but generally in most other locations
you'll find that we have more than one</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/663-3
00:42:13.002 --> 00:42:14.114
<v Warren du Toit>edge location.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/665-0
00:42:14.514 --> 00:42:16.234
<v Warren du Toit>And we would then have.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/670-0
00:42:18.074 --> 00:42:24.058
<v Warren du Toit>Your Expressroute circuits peering to two
different edge locations so that you</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/670-1
00:42:24.058 --> 00:42:29.057
<v Warren du Toit>would have redundancy.
So you'd have link one, link two, primary,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/670-2
00:42:29.057 --> 00:42:33.148
<v Warren du Toit>secondary, primary,
secondary going to different edge</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/670-3
00:42:33.148 --> 00:42:37.314
<v Warren du Toit>locations so that if that one edge
location went down.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/675-0
00:42:37.794 --> 00:42:43.035
<v Warren du Toit>The other edge location would take over,
so we don't currently have that now.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/675-1
00:42:43.035 --> 00:42:46.731
<v Warren du Toit>We will soon.
So we've also got the metro model coming</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/675-2
00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:50.360
<v Warren du Toit>out as well,
and the metro model allows distinct edge</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/675-3
00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:55.669
<v Warren du Toit>locations with a single physical link,
which is going to happen soon where you</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/675-4
00:42:55.669 --> 00:42:56.274
<v Warren du Toit>can have.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/677-0
00:42:56.314 --> 00:43:01.041
<v Warren du Toit>The primary and secondary actually taking
diverse paths as well,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/677-1
00:43:01.041 --> 00:43:04.314
<v Warren du Toit>as opposed to just being like a like a
pair.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/682-0
00:43:05.314 --> 00:43:11.262
<v Warren du Toit>Hopefully that actually comes true and it
doesn't slip. Jan twenty-six is in off.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/682-1
00:43:11.262 --> 00:43:16.268
<v Warren du Toit>Let's hope. Yeah, I hope so.
When it comes to the single circuit bow</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/682-2
00:43:16.268 --> 00:43:19.967
<v Warren du Toit>tie effect,
we have a bunch of customers inside of</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/682-3
00:43:19.967 --> 00:43:22.434
<v Warren du Toit>South Africa that use it this way.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/686-0
00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:27.294
<v Warren du Toit>So you would have Uh standard in South
Africa North,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/686-1
00:43:27.294 --> 00:43:32.887
<v Warren du Toit>Uh standard South Africa West and you'll
see that there's let's say Vnet peering</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/686-2
00:43:32.887 --> 00:43:38.274
<v Warren du Toit>or using a VWAN hub and you'll see that
customers create this bow tie effect.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/688-0
00:43:39.154 --> 00:43:44.754
<v Warren du Toit>For now,
in which case what happens is you'll have</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/688-1
00:43:44.754 --> 00:43:45.194
<v Warren du Toit>the.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/693-0
00:43:46.354 --> 00:43:50.074
<v Warren du Toit>If one of the links goes down,
let's say for South Africa N,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/693-1
00:43:50.074 --> 00:43:54.831
<v Warren du Toit>you could then route via South Africa
West. I mean the latency will increase,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/693-2
00:43:54.831 --> 00:43:57.576
<v Warren du Toit>but at least you'll still have
connectivity.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/693-3
00:43:57.576 --> 00:44:02.455
<v Warren du Toit>So you'll see this would be the ideal way
to create redundancy in South Africa.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/693-4
00:44:02.455 --> 00:44:04.834
<v Warren du Toit>Plus you could also have local as well.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/698-0
00:44:05.274 --> 00:44:08.590
<v Warren du Toit>In this scenario,
a lot of customers do do that because</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/698-1
00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:12.439
<v Warren du Toit>local is also cheaper.
The idea that you have unlimited traffic,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/698-2
00:44:12.439 --> 00:44:15.164
<v Warren du Toit>you'd have that secondary link there as
well.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/698-3
00:44:15.164 --> 00:44:17.947
<v Warren du Toit>I explained global reach a little bit
earlier.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/698-4
00:44:17.947 --> 00:44:21.145
<v Warren du Toit>This is actually what it looks like.
So for instance,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/698-5
00:44:21.145 --> 00:44:23.514
<v Warren du Toit>if you had a DC in Joburg, DC in London.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/702-0
00:44:24.274 --> 00:44:28.943
<v Warren du Toit>And you used our backbone to connect it,
it would be like that.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/702-1
00:44:28.943 --> 00:44:33.539
<v Warren du Toit>So that is what Global Reach is
essentially achieving for you.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/702-2
00:44:33.539 --> 00:44:38.354
<v Warren du Toit>So you can route traffic from one DC to
another DC, but using us.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/703-0
00:44:39.474 --> 00:44:39.594
<v Warren du Toit>OK.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/708-0
00:44:42.274 --> 00:44:48.488
<v Warren du Toit>Then we've got disaster recovery designs,
which I explained a little bit earlier,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/708-1
00:44:48.488 --> 00:44:53.794
<v Warren du Toit>but this is just using VWAN instead.
So you could have Virtual Hub A,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/708-2
00:44:53.794 --> 00:44:59.554
<v Warren du Toit>Virtual Hub B in two regions and you
could have two express short circuits.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/711-0
00:45:00.074 --> 00:45:04.852
<v Warren du Toit>Both going to on premises and it'd be
completely redundant.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/711-1
00:45:04.852 --> 00:45:08.914
<v Warren du Toit>This would be with VPN as opposed to
Expressroute.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/715-0
00:45:10.954 --> 00:45:15.475
<v Warren du Toit>And this would be Express Route with VPN
failover. So for instance,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/715-1
00:45:15.475 --> 00:45:18.998
<v Warren du Toit>if you wanted Express Route,
you have Express Route,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/715-2
00:45:18.998 --> 00:45:23.918
<v Warren du Toit>but you don't have enough money for two,
you could use VPN as a failover.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/715-3
00:45:23.918 --> 00:45:25.514
<v Warren du Toit>So that's also possible.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/717-0
00:45:25.834 --> 00:45:31.874
<v Warren du Toit>I'm gonna touch on this next subject very
briefly. It can get super complicated.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/719-0
00:45:33.194 --> 00:45:33.274
<v Warren du Toit>Um.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/723-0
00:45:36.074 --> 00:45:40.930
<v Warren du Toit>VMware services is essentially an island.
It's a private cloud.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/723-1
00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:46.317
<v Warren du Toit>It has no connectivity to anything,
so ideally you need to connect it.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/723-2
00:45:46.317 --> 00:45:50.414
<v Warren du Toit>So excuse me,
there's a bunch of different ways to do</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/723-3
00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:50.794
<v Warren du Toit>this.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/727-0
00:45:51.434 --> 00:45:57.091
<v Warren du Toit>One is Expressroute,
so you could deploy an Uh gateway and</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/727-1
00:45:57.091 --> 00:46:04.954
<v Warren du Toit>then you could then connect it up like
you would deploy the ADS resource like so.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/732-0
00:46:05.914 --> 00:46:11.553
<v Warren du Toit>And you can use Expressroute Global Reach
and you'll see that it'll connect up the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/732-1
00:46:11.553 --> 00:46:16.989
<v Warren du Toit>AVS network to your Azure Vnet and then
to your DC if you wanted to connect any</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/732-2
00:46:16.989 --> 00:46:21.474
<v Warren du Toit>platform as a service services or
software as a service services.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/735-0
00:46:21.874 --> 00:46:26.376
<v Warren du Toit>It would then do that.
So you would connect up to the Uh gateway</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/735-1
00:46:26.376 --> 00:46:31.294
<v Warren du Toit>inside of Azure on the Vnet.
If you were going to be using a VWAN hub,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/735-2
00:46:31.294 --> 00:46:33.234
<v Warren du Toit>you'd be doing it like that.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/740-0
00:46:37.434 --> 00:46:42.502
<v Warren du Toit>So essentially what you're doing is
you're just replacing the connectivity</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/740-1
00:46:42.502 --> 00:46:47.030
<v Warren du Toit>with the Vnet hub with a VWAN hub.
So that's only real difference.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/740-2
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:52.234
<v Warren du Toit>Then there's IP SEC instead of an
Expressroute gateway. You'd be doing that.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/746-0
00:46:54.354 --> 00:46:58.359
<v Warren du Toit>So you'd have VPN on the one side,
and then you'd have the Express Route</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/746-1
00:46:58.359 --> 00:47:00.937
<v Warren du Toit>gateway specifically just for the AVS
network.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/746-2
00:47:00.937 --> 00:47:03.625
<v Warren du Toit>So there's a bunch of different ways to
do this,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/746-3
00:47:03.625 --> 00:47:07.849
<v Warren du Toit>but you'd also have to have the root
server for this particular way of doing</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/746-4
00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:10.428
<v Warren du Toit>things.
So just remembering when you deploy an</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/746-5
00:47:10.428 --> 00:47:12.897
<v Warren du Toit>AVS network,
this would be the way to do it.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/746-6
00:47:12.897 --> 00:47:13.994
<v Warren du Toit>This is changing in.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/749-0
00:47:14.074 --> 00:47:18.819
<v Warren du Toit>In ABS Gen. 2, in ABS Gen. 2,
we're making it a little bit more simple.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/749-1
00:47:18.819 --> 00:47:23.170
<v Warren du Toit>We're going to be using Vnets to attach
the ABS clusters instead,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/749-2
00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:28.047
<v Warren du Toit>so that it'll be a little bit less
complicated for you to connect up your</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/749-3
00:47:28.047 --> 00:47:29.234
<v Warren du Toit>private cloud, so.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/753-0
00:47:29.434 --> 00:47:35.329
<v Warren du Toit>Looking forward to that next year when it
goes GA. Finally, we're looking at Maps,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/753-1
00:47:35.329 --> 00:47:39.165
<v Warren du Toit>which is Microsoft's Microsoft Azure
Peering service,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/753-2
00:47:39.165 --> 00:47:44.634
<v Warren du Toit>which what we're trying to do here is we
are essentially trying to give you.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/754-0
00:47:45.234 --> 00:47:46.434
<v Warren du Toit>The closest.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/760-0
00:47:47.274 --> 00:47:52.238
<v Warren du Toit>Way to get to Azure.
So ideally what we're doing is we're</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/760-1
00:47:52.238 --> 00:47:59.085
<v Warren du Toit>allowing you to then peer over a service
provider with us so that you could get</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/760-2
00:47:59.085 --> 00:48:06.274
<v Warren du Toit>the quickest entry point into our network.
So let's say before maps you would have.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/764-0
00:48:06.554 --> 00:48:09.871
<v Warren du Toit>3456 hops before you eventually hit our
edge with us.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/764-1
00:48:09.871 --> 00:48:14.540
<v Warren du Toit>What we're doing is with with maps,
what you're doing is you're essentially</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/764-2
00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:18.103
<v Warren du Toit>shortcutting that.
So you'll see straight down the middle</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/764-3
00:48:18.103 --> 00:48:20.991
<v Warren du Toit>there.
What we're doing is we're saying you're</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/764-4
00:48:20.991 --> 00:48:22.834
<v Warren du Toit>going to go straight from you.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/769-0
00:48:23.194 --> 00:48:28.927
<v Warren du Toit>With maps you can essentially one hop,
2 hops. So as opposed to it being 1234,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/769-1
00:48:28.927 --> 00:48:33.354
<v Warren du Toit>you're going to be just going 1-2 and
you're in the network.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/769-2
00:48:33.354 --> 00:48:39.306
<v Warren du Toit>So ideally this is the best way for you
to get the best performance for something</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/769-3
00:48:39.306 --> 00:48:42.354
<v Warren du Toit>like Office 365 with Teams and SharePoint.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/773-0
00:48:42.794 --> 00:48:46.497
<v Warren du Toit>And those sorts of things,
as opposed to using it the old way where</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/773-1
00:48:46.497 --> 00:48:50.581
<v Warren du Toit>we used to do it over Expressroutes,
which was a disaster because you peer</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/773-2
00:48:50.581 --> 00:48:54.720
<v Warren du Toit>your Office 365 services and then
sometimes your Windows Update would break</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/773-3
00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:58.314
<v Warren du Toit>because you get asynchronous routing or
whatever the case may be.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/777-0
00:48:58.394 --> 00:49:03.486
<v Warren du Toit>So this would be the best way to do it.
So you'd have the shortest path to get</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/777-1
00:49:03.486 --> 00:49:07.740
<v Warren du Toit>straight through to us as opposed to
going around. And with that,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/777-2
00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:11.027
<v Warren du Toit>if you've got any questions,
I know that was fast,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/777-3
00:49:11.027 --> 00:49:13.154
<v Warren du Toit>but I think I did it in what, 45?</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/778-0
00:49:11.914 --> 00:49:15.314
<v Nicolas Blank>You did it right on the money.
That was amazing.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/780-0
00:49:16.074 --> 00:49:20.754
<v Warren du Toit>Right. I know it was. I was speaking fast.
I'm sorry.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/784-0
00:49:19.954 --> 00:49:23.153
<v Nicolas Blank>No, it was great. It was great.
I did give a time constraint.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/783-0
00:49:22.114 --> 00:49:22.194
<v Warren du Toit>Huh.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/784-1
00:49:23.153 --> 00:49:25.114
<v Nicolas Blank>You stuck exactly to it, so thank you.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/790-0
00:49:26.154 --> 00:49:31.226
<v Nicolas Blank>So I'd like if whoever is not completely
overwhelmed, actually,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/790-1
00:49:31.226 --> 00:49:34.793
<v Nicolas Blank>let's just do cameras on and no,
not at all.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/787-0
00:49:32.594 --> 00:49:33.874
<v Warren du Toit>Sorry, sorry.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/790-2
00:49:34.793 --> 00:49:40.737
<v Nicolas Blank>Cameras on and and and microphones.
And let's take the opportunity for the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/790-3
00:49:40.737 --> 00:49:43.274
<v Nicolas Blank>next 4 minutes to ask questions.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/799-0
00:49:43.834 --> 00:49:46.805
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>Yep. So first of all,
just want to know if that presentation is</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/799-1
00:49:46.805 --> 00:49:50.427
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>going to be available because as you say,
there's like I thought I had a fair</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/799-2
00:49:50.427 --> 00:49:52.517
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>understanding of Microsoft Azure
networking,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/799-3
00:49:52.517 --> 00:49:56.417
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>but that's just it's interesting to get a
peek behind the curtain and to go and see</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/799-4
00:49:56.417 --> 00:49:59.482
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>exactly what it looks like to know that
you're in your own fibre.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/793-0
00:49:56.434 --> 00:49:56.674
<v Warren du Toit>Hmm.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/799-5
00:49:59.482 --> 00:50:02.036
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>There's things that I'd have a vague
understanding of,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/795-0
00:50:00.594 --> 00:50:00.914
<v Warren du Toit>Mm.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/799-6
00:50:02.036 --> 00:50:03.754
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>but never really lost track of about.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/797-0
00:50:03.594 --> 00:50:04.154
<v Nicolas Blank>Mm.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/810-0
00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:07.228
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>Things like using Express Route,
global peering and things like with the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/810-1
00:50:07.228 --> 00:50:10.948
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>map stuff that you brought up at the end.
Now I'm already curious about who the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/798-0
00:50:07.794 --> 00:50:07.954
<v Warren du Toit>Hm.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/801-0
00:50:09.794 --> 00:50:10.034
<v Warren du Toit>Hmm.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/810-2
00:50:10.948 --> 00:50:14.668
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>peering partners are in South Africa and
how you know who we can use because we</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/810-3
00:50:14.668 --> 00:50:17.412
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>have an ISP that we work with who are
using Express Route.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/804-0
00:50:15.314 --> 00:50:15.634
<v Warren du Toit>Yeah.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/810-4
00:50:17.412 --> 00:50:21.178
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>So they would either like to consume the
service or maybe even become a partner.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/805-0
00:50:17.754 --> 00:50:18.914
<v Warren du Toit>Mm-hmm.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/807-0
00:50:20.234 --> 00:50:20.514
<v Warren du Toit>Yeah.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/810-5
00:50:21.178 --> 00:50:22.434
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>So those kind of questions.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/819-0
00:50:22.634 --> 00:50:26.700
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>So there's a lot. And then you didn't.
I was waiting for you to get into things</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/809-0
00:50:24.834 --> 00:50:25.074
<v Warren du Toit>Yeah.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/819-1
00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:30.462
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>on a deep dive onto Azure Firewall
because that's probably the bit that I</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/819-2
00:50:30.462 --> 00:50:34.275
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>have in my Azure calculator list more
often than not is that I tend to use</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/819-3
00:50:34.275 --> 00:50:37.630
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>virtual machines and go and put down
infrastructure as a service.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/813-0
00:50:34.954 --> 00:50:35.194
<v Warren du Toit>Hmm.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/814-0
00:50:37.194 --> 00:50:37.474
<v Warren du Toit>Yeah.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/819-4
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:41.493
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>So would love to go and get in some
detail on that and the pros and cons of</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/816-0
00:50:41.234 --> 00:50:41.834
<v Warren du Toit>For sure.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/819-5
00:50:41.493 --> 00:50:42.154
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>that, but so.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/821-0
00:50:42.634 --> 00:50:44.854
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>There's a lot.
So rather than just is there,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/817-0
00:50:43.554 --> 00:50:44.194
<v Warren du Toit>There is.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/821-1
00:50:44.854 --> 00:50:48.652
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>obviously we've got the recording.
Is that presentation that you've prepared</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/821-2
00:50:48.652 --> 00:50:50.034
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>going to be shared publicly?</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/828-0
00:50:50.594 --> 00:50:53.588
<v Warren du Toit>So what I can do is I can share it with
you directly.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/828-1
00:50:53.588 --> 00:50:57.913
<v Warren du Toit>So what I'll do is I'll get the details
from Nick and I'll share it with you.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/823-0
00:50:54.954 --> 00:50:55.314
<v Nicolas Blank>Yeah.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/828-2
00:50:57.913 --> 00:51:02.072
<v Warren du Toit>And then when it comes to Maps itself,
just search Microsoft Azure Peering</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/828-3
00:51:02.072 --> 00:51:05.842
<v Warren du Toit>Service on Google or Bing or whatever.
And when you go to the link,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/825-0
00:51:04.314 --> 00:51:04.914
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>Yeah.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/828-4
00:51:05.842 --> 00:51:09.114
<v Warren du Toit>you'll see in our documentation you'll
see there's a very.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/831-0
00:51:09.834 --> 00:51:15.629
<v Warren du Toit>Clear defined list of the partners that
support maps and exactly how to activate</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/831-1
00:51:15.629 --> 00:51:18.777
<v Warren du Toit>it,
because you'll activate it in a tenant,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/831-2
00:51:18.777 --> 00:51:19.994
<v Warren du Toit>I think it costs.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/836-0
00:51:21.834 --> 00:51:25.852
<v Warren du Toit>I think it's like 10 or $20 a month or
something dumb. I mean,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/836-1
00:51:25.852 --> 00:51:29.742
<v Warren du Toit>it's like it could even be $5 a month.
It's something silly.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/836-2
00:51:29.742 --> 00:51:34.590
<v Warren du Toit>You turn it on and then you just do the
peering on your side and it's done.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/836-3
00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:37.651
<v Warren du Toit>That's it.
And then you just start learning the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/835-0
00:51:36.954 --> 00:51:37.394
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>OK.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/836-4
00:51:37.651 --> 00:51:38.034
<v Warren du Toit>roots.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/841-0
00:51:38.434 --> 00:51:43.620
<v Warren du Toit>Then as far as Azure Firewall's concerned,
maybe Nick, we do, I mean,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/838-0
00:51:43.354 --> 00:51:44.114
<v Nicolas Blank>A whole session.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/841-1
00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:48.658
<v Warren du Toit>maybe we do a session. Yeah,
maybe we do a session on like network,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/841-2
00:51:48.658 --> 00:51:53.918
<v Warren du Toit>on like network security and turning all
of those features on and off.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/841-3
00:51:53.918 --> 00:51:57.474
<v Warren du Toit>And maybe we do like a deep dive in the
portal.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/840-0
00:51:55.194 --> 00:51:55.794
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>Yeah.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/843-0
00:51:58.154 --> 00:52:02.433
<v Warren du Toit>You know how to deploy it, what to deploy,
where to deploy,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/843-1
00:52:02.433 --> 00:52:06.070
<v Warren du Toit>how firewall manager works,
all that lovely stuff.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/842-0
00:52:02.594 --> 00:52:02.754
<v Nicolas Blank>Mm.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/843-2
00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:10.564
<v Warren du Toit>I did say I'd share that repo with you as
well, which is here.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/843-3
00:52:10.564 --> 00:52:13.274
<v Warren du Toit>I'm gonna put it in the chat. This is.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/844-0
00:52:13.354 --> 00:52:16.046
<v Warren du Toit>Vince's repo.
You can go have a look there.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/844-1
00:52:16.046 --> 00:52:19.351
<v Warren du Toit>What that'll do is that'll run a a
PowerShell script.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/844-2
00:52:19.351 --> 00:52:23.452
<v Warren du Toit>It'll deploy a bunch of VPN gateways.
It'll connect everything up.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/844-3
00:52:23.452 --> 00:52:27.797
<v Warren du Toit>It'll basically sort of emulate an
on-premises environment and a cloud</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/844-4
00:52:27.797 --> 00:52:32.754
<v Warren du Toit>environment to connect the two together
with two Ubuntu machines on either side.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/845-0
00:52:32.954 --> 00:52:37.720
<v Warren du Toit>And it's going to teach you about
troubleshooting the routing, the routes,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/845-1
00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:41.216
<v Warren du Toit>which tools to use, what to install,
what to look for,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/845-2
00:52:41.216 --> 00:52:46.236
<v Warren du Toit>how to ping this one to there and you
know, not to use just ICMP all the time,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/845-3
00:52:46.236 --> 00:52:50.812
<v Warren du Toit>rather use a TCP ping as well.
So there's a lot of cool stuff that's in</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/845-4
00:52:50.812 --> 00:52:52.274
<v Warren du Toit>there as well and also.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/846-0
00:52:52.834 --> 00:52:57.744
<v Warren du Toit>There is an Azure firewall that actually
gets deployed in that environment,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/846-1
00:52:57.744 --> 00:53:02.847
<v Warren du Toit>so it kind of trips you up a little bit.
There's kind of some cool tricks that</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/846-2
00:53:02.847 --> 00:53:07.757
<v Warren du Toit>Vince has gone and done where he
configures a firewall rule that hurts you.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/846-3
00:53:07.757 --> 00:53:09.954
<v Warren du Toit>So it's actually quite cool, yeah.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/850-0
00:53:09.754 --> 00:53:12.447
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>OK, excellent. Thank you.
I'll take a look because I've been</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/850-1
00:53:12.447 --> 00:53:15.979
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>because that's the one that we have most
with our customer facing items is that</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/847-0
00:53:12.474 --> 00:53:13.154
<v Warren du Toit>Hmm. Yeah.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/850-2
00:53:15.979 --> 00:53:19.423
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>obviously you want to go and have a
firewall and have good security in place.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/848-0
00:53:16.394 --> 00:53:16.634
<v Warren du Toit>Hmm.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/850-3
00:53:19.423 --> 00:53:22.735
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>And then at the moment I'm still putting
down infrastructure as a service,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/850-4
00:53:22.735 --> 00:53:26.002
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>putting a virtual appliance on top of it.
But then you lose the benefits,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/850-5
00:53:26.002 --> 00:53:29.314
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>the advantages of the automatic
redundancy that comes with Azure Firewall.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/854-0
00:53:29.514 --> 00:53:33.092
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>They're really closely integrated
networking and all those kind of things.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/849-0
00:53:29.754 --> 00:53:30.194
<v Warren du Toit>Yep.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/854-1
00:53:33.092 --> 00:53:36.813
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>So then it's and it's it always comes
down to a costing discussion that a few</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/851-0
00:53:33.794 --> 00:53:33.834
<v Warren du Toit>100%.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/854-2
00:53:36.813 --> 00:53:40.582
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>things I have to fail over and then so
that'd be good to go and dive into some</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/854-3
00:53:40.582 --> 00:53:43.874
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>of those and so thank you for sharing the
link. I shall take a look.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/852-0
00:53:42.314 --> 00:53:42.834
<v Warren du Toit>Yeah.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/853-0
00:53:44.834 --> 00:53:45.674
<v Warren du Toit>Pleasure.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/856-0
00:53:46.634 --> 00:53:50.444
<v Warren du Toit>Yeah. Any other questions, just hit me up.
I mean, Nick's got all my details. Yeah,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/855-0
00:53:46.674 --> 00:53:47.874
<v Neil Knapp | Cyberlogic>OK, cool.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/856-1
00:53:50.444 --> 00:53:51.714
<v Warren du Toit>I'm more than happy to help.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/859-0
00:53:57.914 --> 00:54:01.221
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>Thanks, Warren. I'm I'm just,
I'm just overwhelmed,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/857-0
00:53:58.314 --> 00:53:59.154
<v Nicolas Blank>It look oh.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/861-0
00:54:01.194 --> 00:54:05.524
<v Warren du Toit>Yeah, you can see,
you can hear my voice is already.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/859-1
00:54:01.221 --> 00:54:04.274
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>but I'll definitely go through the
information.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/858-0
00:54:02.074 --> 00:54:04.034
<v Schalk van Wyk>Mind blowing.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/861-1
00:54:05.524 --> 00:54:10.100
<v Warren du Toit>My voice is a little hoarse from talking
so fast. Yeah,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/860-0
00:54:09.714 --> 00:54:10.114
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>OK.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/861-2
00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:14.512
<v Warren du Toit>there's there's there's a lot.
But the cool thing is,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/861-3
00:54:14.512 --> 00:54:18.434
<v Warren du Toit>is there's so many different things to
achieve.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/864-0
00:54:18.914 --> 00:54:22.163
<v Warren du Toit>So many different ways to achieve the
same thing.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/862-0
00:54:19.674 --> 00:54:21.474
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>Yeah.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/864-1
00:54:22.163 --> 00:54:27.167
<v Warren du Toit>So depending on the organization and
depending what it is that you're trying</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/864-2
00:54:27.167 --> 00:54:31.131
<v Warren du Toit>to achieve. So like I said,
financial services and compliant</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/864-3
00:54:31.131 --> 00:54:35.549
<v Warren du Toit>customers, they use everything.
Like everything that I spoke about,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/863-0
00:54:33.434 --> 00:54:33.594
<v Nicolas Blank>Mm.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/864-4
00:54:35.549 --> 00:54:38.474
<v Warren du Toit>they turn on like doesn't matter what it
is.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/867-0
00:54:38.714 --> 00:54:43.354
<v Warren du Toit>It doesn't matter what it costs,
they just turn it on and then the</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/867-1
00:54:43.354 --> 00:54:47.441
<v Warren du Toit>complexity triples.
Then there's some customers that are a</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/865-0
00:54:45.314 --> 00:54:45.674
<v Schalk van Wyk>Mm.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/866-0
00:54:46.834 --> 00:54:47.074
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>Yeah.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/867-2
00:54:47.441 --> 00:54:51.043
<v Warren du Toit>little bit more forward thinking where
they say no,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/867-3
00:54:51.043 --> 00:54:56.168
<v Warren du Toit>we don't want a single virtual network
and we don't want a single private</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/867-4
00:54:56.168 --> 00:54:57.554
<v Warren du Toit>endpoint. We'll use.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/868-0
00:54:58.354 --> 00:55:02.001
<v Warren du Toit>Your platform as a service firewall,
we'll use the public endpoints,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/868-1
00:55:02.001 --> 00:55:05.544
<v Warren du Toit>we'll just turn everything off,
we'll use identity as the barrier,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/868-2
00:55:05.544 --> 00:55:08.240
<v Warren du Toit>and then they're cool.
And then they'll just like,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/868-3
00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:11.782
<v Warren du Toit>that's the way they'll do stuff.
And it's actually, it works very,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/868-4
00:55:11.782 --> 00:55:14.214
<v Warren du Toit>very well.
So they'll use conditional access,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/868-5
00:55:14.214 --> 00:55:14.954
<v Warren du Toit>as Nick knows.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/869-0
00:55:14.954 --> 00:55:18.331
<v Warren du Toit>Additional access,
multi factor authentication,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/869-1
00:55:18.331 --> 00:55:22.554
<v Warren du Toit>all that stuff and that's how they'll do
it. So there's no.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/869-2
00:55:22.554 --> 00:55:28.113
<v Warren du Toit>So the more old school you are as a
company, the more of the stuff you'll use.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/869-3
00:55:28.113 --> 00:55:32.969
<v Warren du Toit>The more new school you are,
the less you are because the more cloud</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/869-4
00:55:32.969 --> 00:55:33.954
<v Warren du Toit>native you go.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/870-0
00:55:33.994 --> 00:55:37.806
<v Warren du Toit>You go,
the less you actually have to worry about</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/870-1
00:55:37.806 --> 00:55:43.372
<v Warren du Toit>all the networking. But again,
we have private endpoints for most of our</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/870-2
00:55:43.372 --> 00:55:47.414
<v Warren du Toit>services now.
So like that AI thing that I discussed</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/870-3
00:55:47.414 --> 00:55:50.997
<v Warren du Toit>earlier,
all of the cloud native applications,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/870-4
00:55:50.997 --> 00:55:53.514
<v Warren du Toit>Kubernetes, Azure Container apps.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/872-0
00:55:54.314 --> 00:55:59.989
<v Warren du Toit>App Services, Cognos VB, SQL DB,
all that stuff is available privately,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/872-1
00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:05.190
<v Warren du Toit>so you can route to all of it and the
minute you can route to it,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/872-2
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:07.634
<v Warren du Toit>it just becomes so much easier.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/875-0
00:56:09.114 --> 00:56:15.163
<v Nicolas Blank>I'm quietly well,
I've been rather vocal over the years.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/871-0
00:56:10.154 --> 00:56:10.274
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>OK.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/875-1
00:56:15.163 --> 00:56:23.548
<v Nicolas Blank>I'm a massive fan of Azure Global WAN
because I like to call it poor man's WAN</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/874-0
00:56:20.194 --> 00:56:20.434
<v Warren du Toit>Hmm.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/875-2
00:56:23.548 --> 00:56:25.034
<v Nicolas Blank>because it is.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/881-0
00:56:25.034 --> 00:56:30.041
<v Nicolas Blank>So amazing and so cheap compared to what
you can do for yourself.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/876-0
00:56:26.914 --> 00:56:27.394
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>Yeah.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/878-0
00:56:28.874 --> 00:56:29.234
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>OK.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/877-0
00:56:29.554 --> 00:56:29.714
<v Warren du Toit>E.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/881-1
00:56:30.041 --> 00:56:36.261
<v Nicolas Blank>And the fact that you can do an endpoint
in in Cape Town and pop up in Brazil and</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/879-0
00:56:32.954 --> 00:56:33.434
<v Warren du Toit>Mhm.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/881-2
00:56:36.261 --> 00:56:42.482
<v Nicolas Blank>your routing is just done for you via a
backbone that you just couldn't afford to</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/880-0
00:56:40.194 --> 00:56:40.354
<v Warren du Toit>Mm.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/881-3
00:56:42.482 --> 00:56:44.834
<v Nicolas Blank>assemble. It's just astounding.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/883-0
00:56:43.834 --> 00:56:48.368
<v Warren du Toit>Yeah,
I've actually got a lab at Liquid where</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/883-1
00:56:48.368 --> 00:56:56.156
<v Warren du Toit>I've got a 200 Meg Express routes that
they've graciously given me for testing</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/883-2
00:56:56.156 --> 00:56:59.114
<v Warren du Toit>purposes. I've got a Microtek.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/885-0
00:56:59.514 --> 00:57:06.367
<v Warren du Toit>Device that's terminating it.
I mean it's like 2000 Rand switch and</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/885-1
00:57:06.367 --> 00:57:12.314
<v Warren du Toit>it's terminating the Expressroute
connection and I've got.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/884-0
00:57:06.954 --> 00:57:07.394
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>Yeah.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/887-0
00:57:13.914 --> 00:57:20.073
<v Warren du Toit>AI stuff running in the DC in that rack,
connecting to the large language model in</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/887-1
00:57:20.073 --> 00:57:24.675
<v Warren du Toit>Sweden and East US,
but connecting to a virtual network here.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/886-0
00:57:22.474 --> 00:57:23.074
<v Nicolas Blank>Yeah.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/887-2
00:57:24.675 --> 00:57:30.241
<v Warren du Toit>So all my large language models,
because all the latest models happen that</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/887-3
00:57:30.241 --> 00:57:31.354
<v Warren du Toit>side in Sweden.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/888-0
00:57:31.354 --> 00:57:37.735
<v Warren du Toit>But I usually hear in a DC over a private
network and it's just it's the greatest</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/888-1
00:57:37.735 --> 00:57:38.514
<v Warren du Toit>demo ever.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/889-0
00:57:39.834 --> 00:57:43.674
<v Nicolas Blank>Why in Sweden? Why?
Why does Sweden get things first?</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/891-0
00:57:43.434 --> 00:57:48.092
<v Warren du Toit>Sweden gets all the latest models first,
and to be honest with you,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/891-1
00:57:48.092 --> 00:57:53.777
<v Warren du Toit>I think it's just the data center where
we've got the most capacity at the moment.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/891-2
00:57:53.777 --> 00:57:59.394
<v Warren du Toit>We're deploying GPUs there like nobody's
business. It's efficient, cheap cooling.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/890-0
00:57:58.954 --> 00:57:59.154
<v Nicolas Blank>Mm.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/893-0
00:57:59.674 --> 00:58:03.601
<v Warren du Toit>Because of the environment,
it's nice and cold there,</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/892-0
00:58:02.314 --> 00:58:03.474
<v Nicolas Blank>Yeah, yeah.</v>

00:58:03.601 --> 00:58:06.874
<v Warren du Toit>so we've got a lot of capacity in in
Sweden.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/897-0
00:58:07.834 --> 00:58:12.581
<v Nicolas Blank>I can see that people are dropping like
flies and we've hit that time boundary.</v>

52c78d83-6306-4ac9-ae6b-1ce84cfc632a/894-0
00:58:11.954 --> 00:58:13.234
