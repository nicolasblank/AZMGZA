fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/89-1
00:05:53.213 --> 00:05:58.571
<v Matthew Levy>hands,
how many people here work with Azure on a</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/89-2
00:05:58.571 --> 00:05:59.773
<v Matthew Levy>day-to-day?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/90-0
00:06:04.453 --> 00:06:06.213
<v Matthew Levy>Yay, I see 4/5.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/91-0
00:06:08.173 --> 00:06:08.653
<v Matthew Levy>6.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/92-0
00:06:10.293 --> 00:06:16.354
<v Matthew Levy>Thank you. All right,
so so far I'm seeing a number of people</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/92-1
00:06:16.354 --> 00:06:23.978
<v Matthew Levy>and you can put your hands down again.
How many of you people are slow to put</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/92-2
00:06:23.978 --> 00:06:25.933
<v Matthew Levy>your hands up, Jaco?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/93-0
00:06:26.973 --> 00:06:30.733
<v Matthew Levy>Very good. Thank you. No.
How many of you are?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/94-0
00:06:32.053 --> 00:06:33.253
<v Matthew Levy>Develoers.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/95-0
00:06:34.653 --> 00:06:41.860
<v Matthew Levy>So you write code for a living. Aha. OK,
so there's three people. So unfortunately,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/95-1
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:48.980
<v Matthew Levy>this session's not for you because you'll
probably have so many things that you'll</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/95-2
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.213
<v Matthew Levy>want to correct me on.
And how many of you are administered?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/96-0
00:06:54.533 --> 00:07:00.918
<v Matthew Levy>Administrators within environment.
So and I know that develoers are</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/96-1
00:07:00.918 --> 00:07:03.453
<v Matthew Levy>administrators but like as.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/97-0
00:07:04.933 --> 00:07:11.459
<v Matthew Levy>Your kind of daily describes you have to
administrate administer Azure</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/97-1
00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:12.653
<v Matthew Levy>environments.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/98-0
00:07:14.173 --> 00:07:16.373
<v Matthew Levy>Not so many of you.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/99-0
00:07:18.013 --> 00:07:21.516
<v Matthew Levy>OK, cool.
And then I I guess final question is how</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/99-1
00:07:21.516 --> 00:07:25.773
<v Matthew Levy>many of you have got some experience with
Visual Studio code?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/101-0
00:07:30.453 --> 00:07:35.978
<v Matthew Levy>Or another IDE. Oh, yay. Wow.
Look at that. We can stop this now.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/101-1
00:07:35.978 --> 00:07:41.586
<v Matthew Levy>Stop this session. Let's go.
Let's go and have some lunch. No, no,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/101-2
00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:46.609
<v Matthew Levy>that's brilliant.
So there's a lot of people that have that</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/100-0
00:07:41.933 --> 00:07:43.573
<v Nicolas Blank>Don't be scared.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/101-3
00:07:46.609 --> 00:07:47.613
<v Matthew Levy>use VS code.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/102-0
00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:53.824
<v Matthew Levy>No, but that's brilliant.
That just shows how sort of approachable</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/102-1
00:07:53.824 --> 00:08:00.872
<v Matthew Levy>it is, how easy it is to use it. You know,
you just it's it's open source, it's free,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/102-2
00:08:00.872 --> 00:08:05.133
<v Matthew Levy>you download it,
you install it and off you go and.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/104-0
00:08:05.613 --> 00:08:11.505
<v Matthew Levy>One of the things I experienced recently
because my machine is pretty hardened and</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/104-1
00:08:11.505 --> 00:08:14.628
<v Matthew Levy>locked down.
Even though I don't have admin</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/104-2
00:08:14.628 --> 00:08:18.390
<v Matthew Levy>permissions,
I can still install VS Code and I could</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/104-3
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:22.294
<v Matthew Levy>still install Git and do everything that
I need to do.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/104-4
00:08:22.294 --> 00:08:25.133
<v Matthew Levy>I don't need to be a local admin on the.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/105-0
00:08:25.253 --> 00:08:28.773
<v Matthew Levy>Machine. So that's great.
From a security perspective,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/105-1
00:08:28.773 --> 00:08:30.693
<v Matthew Levy>I'm really hay about that, OK?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/106-0
00:08:31.693 --> 00:08:35.012
<v Matthew Levy>So I'm going to show you some of the
things.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/106-1
00:08:35.012 --> 00:08:39.290
<v Matthew Levy>I've got five or six things that I just
want to show you,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/106-2
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:43.421
<v Matthew Levy>and then it's more of a learning session
for all of us,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/106-3
00:08:43.421 --> 00:08:46.813
<v Matthew Levy>so we can explore and try a couple of
things.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/107-0
00:08:47.253 --> 00:08:52.100
<v Matthew Levy>Maybe they'll work,
maybe they won't work because I'm going</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/107-1
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:58.400
<v Matthew Levy>to lean on some of the GitHub copilot
functionality and we'll see how what we</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/107-2
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.973
<v Matthew Levy>can do. Just before I share my screen,
I do in my current role I do.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/108-0
00:09:06.653 --> 00:09:10.358
<v Matthew Levy>A number of Azure assessments where I'm
assessing other customers,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/108-1
00:09:10.358 --> 00:09:12.293
<v Matthew Levy>Azure environments, assessing them.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/109-0
00:09:14.213 --> 00:09:19.239
<v Matthew Levy>According to the Cloud Adoption framework
or the well architected framework.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/109-1
00:09:19.239 --> 00:09:22.764
<v Matthew Levy>So you know,
making sure that things align with Cloud</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/109-2
00:09:22.764 --> 00:09:27.398
<v Matthew Levy>Adoption Framework for Azure.
And so you'll see a number of the things</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/109-3
00:09:27.398 --> 00:09:32.293
<v Matthew Levy>that I'll show on screen that PowerShell,
that's the other thing I didn't.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/110-0
00:09:33.893 --> 00:09:39.150
<v Matthew Levy>Mention on being an IT admin,
I use PowerShell a lot,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/110-1
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:46.355
<v Matthew Levy>so I don't know any other languages.
I meant to get skilled up on Python,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/110-2
00:09:46.355 --> 00:09:52.293
<v Matthew Levy>but I just haven't gotten around to it.
So PowerShell is my.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/111-0
00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:53.573
<v Matthew Levy>Scripting language of choice.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/112-0
00:09:58.213 --> 00:10:03.780
<v Matthew Levy>So you'll see a bunch of PowerShell.
It's stuff that I actually use and some</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/112-1
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:08.117
<v Matthew Levy>of it I created myself,
some of it it's borrowed from other</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/112-2
00:10:08.117 --> 00:10:11.370
<v Matthew Levy>people,
and some of it's stuff that I've had</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/112-3
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.093
<v Matthew Levy>generated.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/113-0
00:10:12.173 --> 00:10:12.253
<v Matthew Levy>Um.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/114-0
00:10:15.773 --> 00:10:17.613
<v Matthew Levy>OK, so I'm going to share my screen.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/118-0
00:10:26.093 --> 00:10:26.493
<v Matthew Levy>OK, so.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/124-0
00:10:29.573 --> 00:10:37.387
<v Matthew Levy>The first thing I want to show you,
this is just a sort of a default VS code</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/124-1
00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:44.693
<v Matthew Levy>and you can see that it's it's opened the
getting started welcome page.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/127-0
00:10:44.693 --> 00:10:49.640
<v Matthew Levy>Sometimes I like to go back to this and
run some of the things,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/127-1
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.973
<v Matthew Levy>but you can close it often and say never
show this thing again, but.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/128-0
00:10:56.333 --> 00:10:59.013
<v Matthew Levy>What I've got in this profile.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/133-0
00:11:00.933 --> 00:11:06.904
<v Matthew Levy>Is I've got some extensions installed and
what's useful from an Azure perspective,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/133-1
00:11:06.904 --> 00:11:12.227
<v Matthew Levy>especially when it comes to evaluating
and assessing and seeing what's in</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/133-2
00:11:12.227 --> 00:11:15.824
<v Matthew Levy>somebody's tenant,
is all these Azure extensions.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/133-3
00:11:15.824 --> 00:11:18.413
<v Matthew Levy>We know VS Code is quite extendable.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/138-0
00:11:18.853 --> 00:11:23.890
<v Matthew Levy>With all extensions,
I typically go for trusted publishers of</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/138-1
00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:27.465
<v Matthew Levy>extensions,
so Microsoft being one of them.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/138-2
00:11:27.465 --> 00:11:33.476
<v Matthew Levy>And there's also something called
extension packs, which you'll see here,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/138-3
00:11:33.476 --> 00:11:37.213
<v Matthew Levy>this Azure Virtual. Sorry,
not Azure Virtual.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/142-0
00:11:37.693 --> 00:11:41.776
<v Matthew Levy>Azure Tools is an extension pack,
so if I click on it,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/142-1
00:11:41.776 --> 00:11:45.859
<v Matthew Levy>it actually has 12 extensions all within
the one pack,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/142-2
00:11:45.859 --> 00:11:51.574
<v Matthew Levy>so I've only had to install the Azure
Tools extension pack and then it comes</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/142-3
00:11:51.574 --> 00:11:53.133
<v Matthew Levy>with all these other.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/144-0
00:11:53.373 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Matthew Levy>Extensions. Now,
I don't use all of these extensions,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/144-1
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.773
<v Matthew Levy>but they're useful in various situations.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/149-0
00:12:02.373 --> 00:12:09.148
<v Matthew Levy>I go away there's there's or actually
it's better on the left hand side to show</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/149-1
00:12:09.148 --> 00:12:13.128
<v Matthew Levy>you.
So Azure Resources is quite handy because</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/149-2
00:12:13.128 --> 00:12:17.870
<v Matthew Levy>that'll you know,
be able to show me in a tree view the</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/149-3
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.733
<v Matthew Levy>resources that I have.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/154-0
00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:25.037
<v Matthew Levy>But it's limited to specific types of
Azure resources.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/154-1
00:12:25.037 --> 00:12:31.773
<v Matthew Levy>The Azure Storage extension allows me to
see Azure Storage accounts and connect to</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/154-2
00:12:31.773 --> 00:12:37.453
<v Matthew Levy>them, explore Azure Storage.
I've got Azure Virtual Machines because.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/158-0
00:12:37.733 --> 00:12:44.217
<v Matthew Levy>I often have virtual virtual machines in
environments and then we've got GitHub</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/158-1
00:12:44.217 --> 00:12:49.160
<v Matthew Levy>Copilot for Azure.
Now that if you go into the Azure portal,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/158-2
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.293
<v Matthew Levy>you've probably seen the GitHub Copilot
for Azure.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/161-0
00:12:53.973 --> 00:12:59.854
<v Matthew Levy>Or a copilot for Azure.
It's the same copilot essentially,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/161-1
00:12:59.854 --> 00:13:05.933
<v Matthew Levy>it's just surfaced in VS Code through the
GitHub connection.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/165-0
00:13:07.413 --> 00:13:11.874
<v Matthew Levy>So there's some kind of samples of what's
going on there,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/165-1
00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:18.026
<v Matthew Levy>and then obviously I've got the GitHub
Copilot extensions so that I can do some</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/165-2
00:13:18.026 --> 00:13:20.333
<v Matthew Levy>of the GitHub code generation.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/169-0
00:13:21.813 --> 00:13:26.611
<v Matthew Levy>Using GitHub Copilot and incidentally I
use different models,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/169-1
00:13:26.611 --> 00:13:30.944
<v Matthew Levy>don't necessarily use the GPT models that
are provided.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/169-2
00:13:30.944 --> 00:13:35.973
<v Matthew Levy>I sometimes switch to things like Claude,
so I'll show you that.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/174-0
00:13:37.373 --> 00:13:42.450
<v Matthew Levy>And obviously PowerShell.
I've got the PowerShell extension so it</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/174-1
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:48.450
<v Matthew Levy>knows that I'm I'm writing PowerShell
commandlets and so the formatting and I</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/174-2
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:54.296
<v Matthew Levy>can run them within the terminal and
Rainbow CSV is something I came across</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/174-3
00:13:54.296 --> 00:13:55.373
<v Matthew Levy>recently that.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/177-0
00:13:55.453 --> 00:13:59.513
<v Matthew Levy>If you create CSV files and you open them
within VS Code,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/177-1
00:13:59.513 --> 00:14:03.013
<v Matthew Levy>it actually highlights them with some
nice color.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/180-0
00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:09.158
<v Matthew Levy>Line, you know,
it lines up the columns with colour and</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/180-1
00:14:09.158 --> 00:14:14.874
<v Matthew Levy>so it's easy to identify what goes what.
So I mean that's useful for any CSV,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/180-2
00:14:14.874 --> 00:14:16.853
<v Matthew Levy>it's not just Azure, right?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/185-0
00:14:18.213 --> 00:14:23.106
<v Matthew Levy>And then you'll see I've got the
Microsoft Docs MCP installed.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/185-1
00:14:23.106 --> 00:14:28.231
<v Matthew Levy>So that's a an MC model context protocol
server that's installed,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/185-2
00:14:28.231 --> 00:14:34.133
<v Matthew Levy>but it's just for Microsoft Docs,
so it makes a call to the Microsoft Docs.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/186-0
00:14:34.413 --> 00:14:35.853
<v Matthew Levy>MCP API.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/187-0
00:14:37.333 --> 00:14:38.853
<v Matthew Levy>So um.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/192-0
00:14:40.573 --> 00:14:44.383
<v Matthew Levy>It's useful to have these extensions
installed.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/192-1
00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:48.827
<v Matthew Levy>Obviously the other things that I that I
do and I have,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/192-2
00:14:48.827 --> 00:14:54.382
<v Matthew Levy>I've intentionally made my VS code as
bare bones as possible for this</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/192-3
00:14:54.382 --> 00:14:55.493
<v Matthew Levy>demonstration.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/196-0
00:14:55.773 --> 00:15:00.954
<v Matthew Levy>On the accounts section,
so if I click on bottom left accounts,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/196-1
00:15:00.954 --> 00:15:06.054
<v Matthew Levy>I can sign into GitHub to use Copilot.
So I typically do that.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/196-2
00:15:06.054 --> 00:15:12.773
<v Matthew Levy>So I'll click on that and that'll bring
up my on my other window it's bringing up.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/198-0
00:15:13.213 --> 00:15:19.413
<v Matthew Levy>A browser with me signed in to GitHub.
It's useful to have a GitHub account.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/203-0
00:15:20.733 --> 00:15:26.160
<v Matthew Levy>You don't. To use GitHub Copilot,
you need to have a GitHub account,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/203-1
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:31.350
<v Matthew Levy>so you'd have to have that.
So I sign in and that should bring me</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/203-2
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:36.383
<v Matthew Levy>back to VS Code signed in.
And now you can see I'm signed in to</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/203-3
00:15:36.383 --> 00:15:36.933
<v Matthew Levy>GitHub.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/208-0
00:15:39.653 --> 00:15:44.499
<v Matthew Levy>The other thing that you can do,
and it's not necessary for what I do,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/208-1
00:15:44.499 --> 00:15:49.276
<v Matthew Levy>but it's it's useful if you're going to
use some of these extensions,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/208-2
00:15:49.276 --> 00:15:52.961
<v Matthew Levy>is to actually sign in to Azure.
So if I go to Azure,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/208-3
00:15:52.961 --> 00:15:56.373
<v Matthew Levy>I'm not signed in at the moment,
so I'm going to.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/209-0
00:15:57.253 --> 00:15:59.973
<v Matthew Levy>Allow Azure resources to sign in.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/211-0
00:16:01.213 --> 00:16:06.053
<v Matthew Levy>That's going to OUA prompt and I'll
choose another account.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/213-0
00:16:11.493 --> 00:16:11.853
<v Matthew Levy>So.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/216-0
00:16:15.573 --> 00:16:18.573
<v Matthew Levy>Bear with me while I sign in Tye that
long assword.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/220-0
00:16:24.133 --> 00:16:30.376
<v Matthew Levy>Now I don't want my organization to
manage my entire machine,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/220-1
00:16:30.376 --> 00:16:32.893
<v Matthew Levy>I just want Vscode to be.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/225-0
00:16:34.253 --> 00:16:38.621
<v Matthew Levy>Signed in. OK,
so now it's signing into Azure and so I</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/225-1
00:16:38.621 --> 00:16:45.132
<v Matthew Levy>can see subscriptions and I can expand on
the subscriptions and see the resources</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/225-2
00:16:45.132 --> 00:16:50.373
<v Matthew Levy>that this extension supports.
Azure resources extension supports.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/226-0
00:16:51.693 --> 00:16:55.893
<v Matthew Levy>Things like storage accounts and virtual
machines and.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/228-0
00:16:57.013 --> 00:16:59.053
<v Matthew Levy>Whatever kinds of resources you have.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/229-0
00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:01.893
<v Matthew Levy>Um.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/234-0
00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:11.575
<v Matthew Levy>With the GitHub sign in,
I can also connect to GitHub repos or any</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/234-1
00:17:11.575 --> 00:17:20.773
<v Matthew Levy>source control repos for that matter.
So if I go to the source control button.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/235-0
00:17:21.253 --> 00:17:23.213
<v Matthew Levy>I can clone a repo.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/240-0
00:17:24.653 --> 00:17:30.984
<v Matthew Levy>And at the top it's allowing me to enter
a URL or clone from GitHub.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/240-1
00:17:30.984 --> 00:17:37.590
<v Matthew Levy>Because I'm signed in to GitHub,
I can click on this remote sources and</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/240-2
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.333
<v Matthew Levy>then it should see.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/241-0
00:17:40.773 --> 00:17:41.813
<v Matthew Levy>The Um.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/246-0
00:17:43.213 --> 00:17:50.362
<v Matthew Levy>The repos that I have in my account so I
can if I've got some stuff and often I do,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/246-1
00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:55.298
<v Matthew Levy>I've got PowerShell scripts and things in
my GitHub repo.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/246-2
00:17:55.298 --> 00:17:59.213
<v Matthew Levy>Then I can go and use those,
pull those down.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/250-0
00:17:59.893 --> 00:18:07.967
<v Matthew Levy>Tink them to my machine and this is where
I would need the git extension so or the</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/250-1
00:18:07.967 --> 00:18:12.733
<v Matthew Levy>git interpolation and that's let me just
do git.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/254-0
00:18:15.413 --> 00:18:22.673
<v Matthew Levy>So you just Google git and install the
latest version 2 point something and if</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/254-1
00:18:22.673 --> 00:18:29.933
<v Matthew Levy>you don't have it installed it'll tell
you. So VS code is very cool like that.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/258-0
00:18:30.013 --> 00:18:36.027
<v Matthew Levy>With a lot of this stuff you'll see
bottom right hand corner a little pop up</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/258-1
00:18:36.027 --> 00:18:41.806
<v Matthew Levy>telling you you need to sign in or you
need this extension or you need to</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/258-2
00:18:41.806 --> 00:18:46.413
<v Matthew Levy>install git command line so that you can
use git commands.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/261-0
00:18:46.813 --> 00:18:50.013
<v Matthew Levy>Within VS code,
so it actually walks you through that</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/261-1
00:18:50.013 --> 00:18:52.976
<v Matthew Levy>process.
I I don't think it's necessary for me to</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/261-2
00:18:52.976 --> 00:18:56.413
<v Matthew Levy>go through it because I've already done
it on my machine.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/263-0
00:19:00.693 --> 00:19:00.933
<v Matthew Levy>Um.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/267-0
00:19:03.773 --> 00:19:07.521
<v Matthew Levy>So it's busy trying to sign me into
GitHub. I don't know.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/267-1
00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:10.816
<v Matthew Levy>That's to show resources. Uh,
remote repositories.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/267-2
00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:13.013
<v Matthew Levy>Let me just move this out the way.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/269-0
00:19:16.933 --> 00:19:23.213
<v Matthew Levy>Don't know why it's taking so long. I can,
like I said, any yes.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/271-0
00:19:21.733 --> 00:19:24.271
<v Nicolas Blank>Matt,
we're only seeing the Rainbow CSV stuff</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/271-1
00:19:24.271 --> 00:19:27.251
<v Nicolas Blank>on your screen.
I'm not sure if there's anything else</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/278-0
00:19:26.813 --> 00:19:30.463
<v Matthew Levy>Yeah, no, no, no.
I'm sharing my entire screen.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/271-2
00:19:27.251 --> 00:19:28.133
<v Nicolas Blank>still happening.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/278-1
00:19:30.463 --> 00:19:36.469
<v Matthew Levy>So what was happening was it was down the
bottom right hand corner of VS code.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/274-0
00:19:36.253 --> 00:19:36.613
<v Nicolas Blank>Mm.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/278-2
00:19:36.469 --> 00:19:42.324
<v Matthew Levy>Hopefully you could see that it was
trying to authenticate to GitHub, which,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/275-0
00:19:37.493 --> 00:19:37.973
<v Nicolas Blank>Yes.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/278-3
00:19:42.324 --> 00:19:45.973
<v Matthew Levy>oh, it popped up on another screen,
that's why.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/281-0
00:19:46.333 --> 00:19:53.711
<v Matthew Levy>For me to authorize that not finished.
Would you like to try a different way?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/281-1
00:19:53.711 --> 00:19:55.413
<v Matthew Levy>Let's just say no.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/282-0
00:19:56.853 --> 00:19:58.613
<v Matthew Levy>And so um.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/284-0
00:20:00.093 --> 00:20:01.573
<v Matthew Levy>Try that again. Sorry.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/286-0
00:20:07.733 --> 00:20:09.253
<v Matthew Levy>That's why it took so long.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/288-0
00:20:11.813 --> 00:20:12.573
<v Matthew Levy>There we go.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/292-0
00:20:13.973 --> 00:20:18.951
<v Matthew Levy>There we go.
So now it's listing my the repos that are</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/292-1
00:20:18.951 --> 00:20:26.010
<v Matthew Levy>in my GitHub. OK, so I could choose that.
Or what I've done many times is use</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/292-2
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:28.453
<v Matthew Levy>somebody else's repos just.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/297-0
00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:37.106
<v Matthew Levy>Just because they've got useful content
in them. One of them that I like to well,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/297-1
00:20:37.106 --> 00:20:44.453
<v Matthew Levy>no one that I cloned recently is the
Maester repo from Merrill Fernando.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/295-0
00:20:40.493 --> 00:20:40.933
Yeah.

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/302-0
00:20:45.413 --> 00:20:51.818
<v Matthew Levy>So you just basically paste the URL from
that repo into the clone repo and click</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/302-1
00:20:51.818 --> 00:20:58.064
<v Matthew Levy>clone from and then it creates a clone.
It asks you where you want to store it</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/302-2
00:20:58.064 --> 00:20:59.013
<v Matthew Levy>locally, so.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/305-0
00:21:00.693 --> 00:21:04.123
<v Matthew Levy>You choose a folder locally,
locally on the machine,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/305-1
00:21:04.123 --> 00:21:09.493
<v Matthew Levy>and then it'll store it wherever you've
said, and so I've actually got the master.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/311-0
00:21:11.053 --> 00:21:16.333
<v Matthew Levy>Repo already cloned on my machine,
so I'm not going to clone it again.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/311-1
00:21:16.333 --> 00:21:22.505
<v Matthew Levy>You can see if you clone something twice
it'll like this Intune management folder.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/311-2
00:21:22.505 --> 00:21:28.453
<v Matthew Levy>I cloned it and then cloned it again.
That was me being silly actually because.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/315-0
00:21:28.973 --> 00:21:35.847
<v Matthew Levy>I wanted to use the dev branch of this
Intune management repo and I didn't want</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/315-1
00:21:35.847 --> 00:21:40.144
<v Matthew Levy>to mess with the branch that I had on my
machine,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/315-2
00:21:40.144 --> 00:21:45.213
<v Matthew Levy>so I created a separate one only to
realize later on that.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/319-0
00:21:46.573 --> 00:21:51.514
<v Matthew Levy>Once you've cloned the repo,
you can switch to the branch from within</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/319-1
00:21:51.514 --> 00:21:54.903
<v Matthew Levy>VS code,
but that's that's actually something I</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/319-2
00:21:54.903 --> 00:21:58.573
<v Matthew Levy>can show you towards the end if we get
enough time.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/324-0
00:22:02.573 --> 00:22:08.548
<v Matthew Levy>So I'm not going to clone that repo at
this stage. I just want to show.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/324-1
00:22:08.548 --> 00:22:13.444
<v Matthew Levy>Let's have a look at these VMS.
These VMS are deallocated.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/324-2
00:22:13.444 --> 00:22:19.253
<v Matthew Levy>I can actually perform actions on these
VMS from within here, so the.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/377-0
00:22:31.845 --> 00:22:37.712
<v Matthew Levy>Perform actions on resources without ever
having to go to portal. So you know,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/377-1
00:22:37.712 --> 00:22:43.133
<v Matthew Levy>I've intentionally got these VMS
deallocated so I can go ahead and start</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/377-2
00:22:43.133 --> 00:22:47.960
<v Matthew Levy>the VM if I wanted to.
Not that I'm going to do anything with it</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/377-3
00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.445
<v Matthew Levy>right now, but just.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/383-0
00:22:49.605 --> 00:22:53.052
<v Matthew Levy>To show you,
you can do things with Azure resources</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/383-1
00:22:53.052 --> 00:22:54.245
<v Matthew Levy>from within, yeah.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/384-0
00:22:55.685 --> 00:22:55.845
<v Matthew Levy>Um.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/433-0
00:23:00.885 --> 00:23:07.125
<v Matthew Levy>What I'm going to show you now is the and
and this is a a feature of VS Code.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/433-1
00:23:07.125 --> 00:23:13.365
<v Matthew Levy>It's not necessarily an Azure function or
magic. That is the profiles, right?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/433-2
00:23:13.365 --> 00:23:18.725
<v Matthew Levy>And so I've got a number of profiles down
here on the bottom left.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/476-0
00:23:19.365 --> 00:23:25.224
<v Matthew Levy>And I'm actually going to switch to the
default profile and you'll see now that</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/476-1
00:23:25.224 --> 00:23:30.644
<v Matthew Levy>I've got a number of other extensions
that are part of my default VS code</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/476-2
00:23:30.644 --> 00:23:34.525
<v Matthew Levy>installation,
so there's some additional extensions.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/506-0
00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:42.134
<v Matthew Levy>And with profiles you can customize how
it looks, what extensions show up,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/506-1
00:23:42.134 --> 00:23:46.110
<v Matthew Levy>which folders work with that profile,
et cetera, et cetera.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/506-2
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:50.085
<v Matthew Levy>And so one of the cool things I wanted to
show you is if I.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/539-0
00:23:50.525 --> 00:23:57.233
<v Matthew Levy>I'm in the default profile,
but I open a folder that I always use for</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/539-1
00:23:57.233 --> 00:24:02.982
<v Matthew Levy>Azure assessments.
It changes automatically to that profile</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/539-2
00:24:02.982 --> 00:24:07.965
<v Matthew Levy>because of the folder.
So if I go file open folder.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/541-0
00:24:10.765 --> 00:24:11.325
<v Matthew Levy>And.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/544-0
00:24:13.205 --> 00:24:14.205
<v Matthew Levy>Go here.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/546-0
00:24:16.565 --> 00:24:16.805
<v Matthew Levy>Oops.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/550-0
00:24:18.085 --> 00:24:19.885
<v Matthew Levy>And open this folder.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/582-0
00:24:20.845 --> 00:24:28.508
<v Matthew Levy>It automatically changed to that profile,
so it's now live mode again and it's got</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/582-1
00:24:28.508 --> 00:24:35.525
<v Matthew Levy>those extensions that I need for the
Azure assessment that I'm going to do.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/627-0
00:24:36.125 --> 00:24:41.620
<v Matthew Levy>And you can see down the bottom right
it's kind of prompting me my PowerShell</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/627-1
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:46.199
<v Matthew Levy>version is out of date,
so I could install the latest version of</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/627-2
00:24:46.199 --> 00:24:50.144
<v Matthew Levy>7.5.4. I know 7.5.
3 is OK and I can carry on using it,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/627-3
00:24:50.144 --> 00:24:53.525
<v Matthew Levy>but if I've got some time I could go
ahead and.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/655-0
00:24:54.525 --> 00:25:01.263
<v Matthew Levy>Update the PowerShell version.
I'm not gonna do that now on this call</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/655-1
00:25:01.263 --> 00:25:06.943
<v Matthew Levy>because you know,
demo gods will probably not favor me and</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/655-2
00:25:06.943 --> 00:25:09.445
<v Matthew Levy>something will happen. Oh.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/667-0
00:25:11.005 --> 00:25:16.520
<v Matthew Levy>Tashman is asking if I can zoom in.
I haven't figured out how to do that with</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/667-1
00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.005
<v Matthew Levy>VS code to be honest.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/674-0
00:25:19.165 --> 00:25:22.445
<v Matthew Levy>If anyone knows how to zoom VS code.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/677-0
00:25:25.445 --> 00:25:26.765
<v Matthew Levy>That would be useful.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/678-0
00:25:28.845 --> 00:25:29.085
<v Matthew Levy>You.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/688-0
00:25:30.845 --> 00:25:35.965
<v Matthew Levy>Appearance. Uh, full screen. Uh, zoom.
There we go.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/689-0
00:25:38.805 --> 00:25:38.885
<v Matthew Levy>Huh.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/692-0
00:25:40.245 --> 00:25:41.365
<v Matthew Levy>We did it.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/697-0
00:25:43.965 --> 00:25:45.605
<v Matthew Levy>I get there now.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/707-0
00:25:46.325 --> 00:25:49.405
<v Nicolas Blank>I think on Windows you can also do.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/713-0
00:25:48.085 --> 00:25:53.725
<v Matthew Levy>Control control Lus equals control Lus
minus.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/711-0
00:25:51.645 --> 00:25:52.685
<v Nicolas Blank>Yeah, yeah.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/726-0
00:25:54.965 --> 00:25:58.275
<v Matthew Levy>Control and equals.
I was doing control zoom with the mouse,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/726-1
00:25:58.275 --> 00:25:59.685
<v Matthew Levy>so maybe that's why I was.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/731-0
00:26:02.885 --> 00:26:05.805
<v Matthew Levy>Look at that. Is that better?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/736-0
00:26:06.965 --> 00:26:09.245
<v Nicolas Blank>Better for me, it's age appropriate.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/748-0
00:26:09.245 --> 00:26:13.613
<v Matthew Levy>Yeah, OK,
so should I start again now that everyone</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/748-1
00:26:13.613 --> 00:26:14.285
<v Matthew Levy>can see?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/751-0
00:26:13.845 --> 00:26:15.845
<v Nicolas Blank>Start everything from scratch, please.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/752-0
00:26:15.445 --> 00:26:19.205
<v Matthew Levy>Yeah, OK, so.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/790-0
00:26:21.165 --> 00:26:26.845
<v Matthew Levy>So what I showed you there was that
profiles and and just going into the</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/790-1
00:26:26.845 --> 00:26:31.436
<v Matthew Levy>profiles you can edit what folders open
with that profile.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/790-2
00:26:31.436 --> 00:26:36.805
<v Matthew Levy>So let me just because my terminal is
taking up a lot of space here.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/826-0
00:26:37.365 --> 00:26:43.133
<v Matthew Levy>You'll see that the folder that I'm in is
part of this Azure assessment profiles,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/826-1
00:26:43.133 --> 00:26:48.690
<v Matthew Levy>but I could remove it and then it's not
going to open this profile when I open</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/826-2
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.925
<v Matthew Levy>that folder and then you can see I've got
it.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/851-0
00:26:52.365 --> 00:26:57.405
<v Matthew Levy>A number of other folders that will open
this type of profile.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/851-1
00:26:57.405 --> 00:27:03.565
<v Matthew Levy>Some other cool profiles that I've got
are Doc Rioter which does a lot of so</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/851-2
00:27:03.565 --> 00:27:06.845
<v Matthew Levy>it's it's got markdown editors in it and.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/881-0
00:27:07.445 --> 00:27:14.901
<v Matthew Levy>Style checkers and editing tools so you
can actually use this as a a replacement</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/881-1
00:27:14.901 --> 00:27:21.344
<v Matthew Levy>for writing documentation.
So you don't necessarily need to use Word,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/881-2
00:27:21.344 --> 00:27:23.645
<v Matthew Levy>which I often fight with.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/927-0
00:27:24.045 --> 00:27:31.517
<v Matthew Levy>Another cool profile is the ISE mode.
So if you are an admin that's used to</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/927-1
00:27:31.517 --> 00:27:38.005
<v Matthew Levy>PowerShell and using ISE,
the ISE mode just it switches the color</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/927-2
00:27:38.005 --> 00:27:43.805
<v Matthew Levy>scheme and makes it look a lot more like
ISE than VS Code.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/963-0
00:27:44.005 --> 00:27:51.321
<v Matthew Levy>Is pretty cool and I'm just I've got some
other things that I'm playing around with.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/963-1
00:27:51.321 --> 00:27:57.432
<v Matthew Levy>So let me just show you some of the
PowerShell stuff that I do and and</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/963-2
00:27:57.432 --> 00:28:02.165
<v Matthew Levy>obviously connecting to Azure to run
PowerShell needs.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/968-0
00:28:02.605 --> 00:28:06.805
<v Matthew Levy>Um, the AZ PowerShell commandlets. Um, so.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/979-0
00:28:07.965 --> 00:28:13.485
<v Matthew Levy>I make sure that I've got the the AC
module installed.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1035-0
00:28:14.845 --> 00:28:18.311
<v Matthew Levy>So that's something that if you try and
run some of the commands,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1035-1
00:28:18.311 --> 00:28:21.830
<v Matthew Levy>you'll see that they won't work because
you don't have the module.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1035-2
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:26.137
<v Matthew Levy>So you just basically install the module.
I'm going to connect to my tenant here.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1035-3
00:28:26.137 --> 00:28:29.445
<v Matthew Levy>It's just so what I'm doing is
highlighting and then pressing.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1055-0
00:28:30.725 --> 00:28:40.165
<v Matthew Levy>F8 and that runs down the bottom in the
terminal. I'll make it bigger, yes.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1082-0
00:28:38.165 --> 00:28:41.572
<v Nicolas Blank>Sorry Matt,
is that your PowerShell or is the</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1082-1
00:28:41.572 --> 00:28:47.201
<v Nicolas Blank>assessment PowerShell that you are
looking at part of an external repo that</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1082-2
00:28:47.201 --> 00:28:49.645
<v Nicolas Blank>folks can come follow along with?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1070-0
00:28:47.205 --> 00:28:47.405
<v Matthew Levy>Hm.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1115-0
00:28:49.565 --> 00:28:53.256
<v Matthew Levy>This is mine.
So this is something that I've got</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1115-1
00:28:53.256 --> 00:28:59.356
<v Matthew Levy>internally in a a repo because it's just
a number of PowerShell things that I've</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1115-2
00:28:59.356 --> 00:29:05.005
<v Matthew Levy>put together in an in a one long file,
but I'm, you know, there's nothing.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1145-0
00:29:05.965 --> 00:29:13.850
<v Matthew Levy>Secret in it, but I can't really share it.
It's not really useful to anyone,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1126-0
00:29:10.645 --> 00:29:11.645
<v Nicolas Blank>Sure, sure.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1145-1
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:21.325
<v Matthew Levy>so let me just authenticate here and
you'll see now I'm connected to an.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1169-0
00:29:21.565 --> 00:29:28.374
<v Matthew Levy>A tenant and there's a subscription.
This function that I've got here is just</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1169-1
00:29:28.374 --> 00:29:35.445
<v Matthew Levy>something that a colleague of mine wrote
just to convert some things to markdown</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1169-2
00:29:35.445 --> 00:29:36.405
<v Matthew Levy>because we.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1181-0
00:29:36.765 --> 00:29:42.365
<v Matthew Levy>We provide reports with markdown and so
I'm just going to run that function.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1194-0
00:29:45.765 --> 00:29:50.506
<v Matthew Levy>Because you'll see some of the other
commands that are run.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1194-1
00:29:50.506 --> 00:29:52.165
<v Matthew Levy>Where is it later on?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1228-0
00:29:55.485 --> 00:30:00.406
<v Matthew Levy>Convert to Markdown.
So I call that function and then I can</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1228-1
00:30:00.406 --> 00:30:05.490
<v Matthew Levy>paste what's on the clipboard into a
brand new Markdown file.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1228-2
00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:11.805
<v Matthew Levy>It just makes it easier for reading in
Markdown. So things that I can do is.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1242-0
00:30:12.925 --> 00:30:19.940
<v Matthew Levy>Just run a couple of commands to go and
interrogate the tenant about the</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1242-1
00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.285
<v Matthew Levy>subscriptions.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1275-0
00:30:24.005 --> 00:30:30.148
<v Matthew Levy>And what do we get back? Did we get any?
Let's see subscriptions. Yeah,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1275-1
00:30:30.148 --> 00:30:34.670
<v Matthew Levy>there's one subscription and things that.
So I mean,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1275-2
00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:40.045
<v Matthew Levy>I'm not going to go through all of the
things that I run here.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1316-0
00:30:41.645 --> 00:30:47.506
<v Matthew Levy>It's up to you if you've got things in
Azure that you want to specifically ask</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1316-1
00:30:47.506 --> 00:30:51.067
<v Matthew Levy>about. You know,
there's the Azure commandlets,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1316-2
00:30:51.067 --> 00:30:56.334
<v Matthew Levy>the easy commandlets, and then I also,
because I'm an identity person,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1316-3
00:30:56.334 --> 00:30:58.485
<v Matthew Levy>I do a lot of stuff on Entra.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1347-0
00:30:59.525 --> 00:31:07.474
<v Matthew Levy>Which means I need to connect to graph.
So I have the graph PowerShell modules</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1347-1
00:31:07.474 --> 00:31:15.221
<v Matthew Levy>and I would do a connect MG graph if I
need to do any sort of intra types of</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1347-2
00:31:15.221 --> 00:31:15.925
<v Matthew Levy>things.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1362-0
00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:22.010
<v Matthew Levy>Interrogate,
ask for users in groups and things like</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1362-1
00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:24.325
<v Matthew Levy>that. OI can do that.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1406-0
00:31:25.805 --> 00:31:31.790
<v Matthew Levy>Some of this PowerShell script I've
borrowed or I've written and I've just</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1406-1
00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:35.301
<v Matthew Levy>added to it.
Some of it I used the Copilot,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1406-2
00:31:35.301 --> 00:31:40.727
<v Matthew Levy>the GitHub Copilot magic,
which because I'm now signed into GitHub,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1406-3
00:31:40.727 --> 00:31:41.285
<v Matthew Levy>I have.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1422-0
00:31:41.845 --> 00:31:49.182
<v Matthew Levy>The copilot and in fact this thing has
oed out on the right hand side,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1422-1
00:31:49.182 --> 00:31:51.765
<v Matthew Levy>so I can use this now to.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1465-0
00:31:55.365 --> 00:32:00.533
<v Matthew Levy>Do a number of things,
and with the GitHub copilot you you've</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1465-1
00:32:00.533 --> 00:32:06.617
<v Matthew Levy>got the different modes you can ask,
and that's very similar to like the</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1465-2
00:32:06.617 --> 00:32:12.285
<v Matthew Levy>ChatGPT functionality where you're just
having a conversation with.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1494-0
00:32:12.885 --> 00:32:19.125
<v Matthew Levy>Copilot and it's suggesting things and
then you still need to go and copy the</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1494-1
00:32:19.125 --> 00:32:25.525
<v Matthew Levy>code and paste it in your your script or
you know, run sections of it yourself.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1512-0
00:32:27.005 --> 00:32:31.424
<v Matthew Levy>The other mode is the ask mode. Sorry,
the agent mode.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1512-1
00:32:31.424 --> 00:32:36.485
<v Matthew Levy>I'm getting confused there the agent mode
which will actually.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1521-0
00:32:38.645 --> 00:32:44.365
<v Matthew Levy>Execute the command so you can say I.
In fact, let's let's try this.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1528-0
00:32:45.325 --> 00:32:51.925
<v Matthew Levy>I don't care about the the context, so.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1538-0
00:32:54.125 --> 00:32:59.725
<v Matthew Levy>I need a list of virtual machines in.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1541-0

00:33:07.245 --> 00:33:16.239
<v Matthew Levy>Use PowerShell to get the information.
Let's see what it does.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1567-1
00:33:16.239 --> 00:33:22.805
<v Matthew Levy>I'm using Claude because I found that it
has.</v>

00:33:24.205 --> 00:33:29.652
<v Matthew Levy>I just find better code comes out of
Claude than the GitHub,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1601-1
00:33:29.652 --> 00:33:35.278
<v Matthew Levy>the the ChatGPT models,
but it's really it's you're up to your</v>

Try them and I think it's also dependent</v>

00:33:54.205 --> 00:33:56.845
<v Matthew Levy>What?
I'll help you get a list of virtual</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1648-1
00:33:56.845 --> 00:34:01.811
<v Matthew Levy>machines in the tenant using PowerShell
based on your existing script pattern.</v>

00:34:01.811 --> 00:34:05.645
<v Matthew Levy>I'll add a section. OK,
so it's going to add a section to my</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1648-3

00:34:08.445 --> 00:34:12.066
<v Matthew Levy>Virtual machines retrieve all virtual
machines,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1682-1
00:34:12.066 --> 00:34:18.328
<v Matthew Levy>loop through all enabled subscriptions,

00:34:23.565 --> 00:34:30.123
<v Matthew Levy>You can see it's highlighted it there and
now it hasn't actually run it,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1711-1
00:34:30.123 --> 00:34:35.063
<v Matthew Levy>but I can keep all of that and let's see
what it does.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1711-2
00:34:35.063 --> 00:34:39.285
<v Matthew Levy>It's very big and zoomy for me,
so let's just.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1745-0
00:34:39.485 --> 00:34:47.885
<v Matthew Levy>Maybe I can zoom out just a tad.
So VMS for each sub in subs for each VM</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1745-1
00:34:47.885 --> 00:34:56.285
<v Matthew Levy>and like as an administrator who knows
PowerShell, I'm going to kind of.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1769-0
00:34:56.445 --> 00:35:01.821
<v Matthew Levy>Cast my eye over it to see if it makes
sense, but I don't have to.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1769-1
00:35:01.821 --> 00:35:07.919
<v Matthew Levy>I could just run it and see what happens.
Then yeah, let's get up to there.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1769-2
00:35:07.919 --> 00:35:09.925
<v Matthew Levy>So format table, so if 8.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1823-0
00:35:18.485 --> 00:35:23.392
<v Matthew Levy>So it's looping through the subscriptions
and then it's giving me the two virtual</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1823-1
00:35:23.392 --> 00:35:27.701
<v Matthew Levy>machines that I have listed and it's
giving me some useful information,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1823-2
00:35:27.701 --> 00:35:32.129
<v Matthew Levy>the subscription, the resource.
Now what I could do because I've got that</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1823-3
00:35:32.129 --> 00:35:33.685
<v Matthew Levy>convert to markdown table.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1834-0
00:35:34.485 --> 00:35:40.808
<v Matthew Levy>Now I've got a table there that
PowerShell has outputted for me and</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1834-1
00:35:40.808 --> 00:35:41.645
<v Matthew Levy>actually.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1873-0
00:35:43.645 --> 00:35:48.438
<v Matthew Levy>GitHub Copilot knew that I used that
function and added it so you can see it</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1873-1
00:35:48.438 --> 00:35:52.919
<v Matthew Levy>to actually put that convert to markdown
table. I didn't even see that,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1873-2
00:35:52.919 --> 00:35:56.343
<v Matthew Levy>so that's brilliant.
Let's run that and copy it to the</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1873-3
00:35:56.343 --> 00:35:56.965
<v Matthew Levy>clipboard.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1906-0
00:35:58.565 --> 00:36:04.039
<v Matthew Levy>So that's done.
So what I can do is then go file new file</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1906-1
00:36:04.039 --> 00:36:08.570
<v Matthew Levy>and select.
It's a markdown file and just paste</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1906-2
00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:14.138
<v Matthew Levy>what's on my clipboard.
So now that's a markdown file if I</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1906-3
00:36:14.138 --> 00:36:15.365
<v Matthew Levy>preview this.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1925-0
00:36:16.085 --> 00:36:21.770
<v Matthew Levy>Open preview. Oh look, it's nice.
I can put that in a nice and I can add,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1925-1
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:27.224
<v Matthew Levy>you know, different text to it.
So it's it's a nice little output in a</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1925-2
00:36:27.224 --> 00:36:27.685
<v Matthew Levy>table.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1928-0
00:36:30.045 --> 00:36:32.085
<v Matthew Levy>Which is pretty cool.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1973-0
00:36:35.245 --> 00:36:40.628
<v Matthew Levy>And then if I were connected to,
I'm not right now. If I go to, yeah,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1973-1
00:36:40.628 --> 00:36:44.703
<v Matthew Levy>source control,
I'm not connected to source control,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/1973-2
00:36:44.703 --> 00:36:50.085
<v Matthew Levy>but because I've updated that assessment
copy file, I could actually.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2009-0
00:36:50.965 --> 00:36:54.554
<v Matthew Levy>Oh,
I like that change where it's gone and</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2009-1
00:36:54.554 --> 00:37:01.399
<v Matthew Levy>got the resources or the virtual machines.
I can now save that and stage it to my</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2009-2
00:37:01.399 --> 00:37:07.325
<v Matthew Levy>local repo and then I can sync it which
will push it up using the git.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2038-0
00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:13.874
<v Matthew Levy>Tool to the source, the remote repository,
so my colleagues can then just pull</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2038-1
00:37:13.874 --> 00:37:18.623
<v Matthew Levy>assessment copy and they'll have an
updated version with oh,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2038-2
00:37:18.623 --> 00:37:22.125
<v Matthew Levy>it's got stuff that'll get the VMS in
there.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2040-0
00:37:24.125 --> 00:37:26.445
<v Matthew Levy>Which I think is pretty cool. Um.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2062-0
00:37:29.005 --> 00:37:32.959
<v Matthew Levy>Yeah,
so that's the the GitHub copilot stuff.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2062-1
00:37:32.959 --> 00:37:37.085
<v Matthew Levy>There's a lot more.
I've done some things with.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2075-0
00:37:39.285 --> 00:37:46.365
<v Matthew Levy>And I suppose I would call this vibe
coding where I've.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2086-0
00:37:48.005 --> 00:37:52.725
<v Matthew Levy>I was given or I was given a Jason file
with.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2126-0
00:37:53.765 --> 00:37:59.155
<v Matthew Levy>Some configuration in it and I I I could
read the Jason file,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2126-1
00:37:59.155 --> 00:38:06.109
<v Matthew Levy>but I didn't quite know how to provision
something into Azure using those Jason</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2126-2
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:09.325
<v Matthew Levy>Jason files and so I was able to get.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2139-0
00:38:09.685 --> 00:38:15.645
<v Matthew Levy>GitHub Copilot to write a script,
a PowerShell script that would then.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2172-0
00:38:16.405 --> 00:38:23.024
<v Matthew Levy>Convert those Jason files into the
correct formats for an ARM template or a</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2172-1
00:38:23.024 --> 00:38:30.165
<v Matthew Levy>bicep template that I could then deploy
using PowerShell and it did it all using.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2203-0
00:38:31.965 --> 00:38:36.895
<v Matthew Levy>PowerShell. So it wrote.
It converted the the JSON,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2203-1
00:38:36.895 --> 00:38:44.574
<v Matthew Levy>converted them to ARM templates or bicep
templates and then I was able to deploy</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2203-2
00:38:44.574 --> 00:38:46.565
<v Matthew Levy>similarly with Entra.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2218-0
00:38:47.005 --> 00:38:54.311
<v Matthew Levy>And I might be able to show you that I've
got things that I wanted to deploy into</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2218-1
00:38:54.311 --> 00:38:54.845
<v Matthew Levy>Entra.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2266-0
00:38:57.405 --> 00:39:01.871
<v Matthew Levy>Security groups,
but they needed to be role based security</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2266-1
00:39:01.871 --> 00:39:05.579
<v Matthew Levy>groups.
Now when you're creating security groups</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2266-2
00:39:05.579 --> 00:39:09.288
<v Matthew Levy>in Entra,
if you want them to be role assignable</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2266-3
00:39:09.288 --> 00:39:13.526
<v Matthew Levy>groups, sorry,
not role based role assignable groups in</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2266-4
00:39:13.526 --> 00:39:15.645
<v Matthew Levy>Entra, you can only do that.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2303-0
00:39:15.725 --> 00:39:20.161
<v Matthew Levy>When you're provisioning the group,
creating the group,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2303-1
00:39:20.161 --> 00:39:26.102
<v Matthew Levy>you can't change that flag once a group
exists. So I was, I was, you know,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2303-2
00:39:26.102 --> 00:39:31.805
<v Matthew Levy>kind of struggling through creating a
group. Oh, I realized it's not a.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2340-0
00:39:32.365 --> 00:39:36.333
<v Matthew Levy>Role assignable group.
I need to go and set the flag. Oh,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2340-1
00:39:36.333 --> 00:39:42.011
<v Matthew Levy>you can't set that because it's already
provisioned. You have to delete the group.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2340-2
00:39:42.011 --> 00:39:47.689
<v Matthew Levy>So deleted the group and then had GitHub
Copilot write a script for me to identify</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2340-3
00:39:47.689 --> 00:39:49.125
<v Matthew Levy>if the group existed.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2362-0
00:39:49.485 --> 00:39:53.377
<v Matthew Levy>Or not. And if it did, did I want?
If it didn't,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2362-1
00:39:53.377 --> 00:39:57.746
<v Matthew Levy>did I want it to be role assignable or
not? Yes or no?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2362-2
00:39:57.746 --> 00:40:00.685
<v Matthew Levy>And basically it ran a a nice little.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2380-0
00:40:01.805 --> 00:40:07.962
<v Matthew Levy>Interface that asked me questions and
created these role assignable groups</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2380-1
00:40:07.962 --> 00:40:11.245
<v Matthew Levy>based off of some config files. Nicolas.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2382-0
00:40:12.685 --> 00:40:14.885
<v Nicolas Blank>Giving you your 10 minute warning.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2406-0
00:40:14.845 --> 00:40:23.239
<v Matthew Levy>OK, well, 10 minutes I am.
There's there's not a lot more than I can</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2406-1
00:40:23.239 --> 00:40:26.645
<v Matthew Levy>show. I I I think we've got.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2436-0
00:40:28.045 --> 00:40:34.041
<v Matthew Levy>I want to try and show you the the role
assignable group script that I wrote,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2436-1
00:40:34.041 --> 00:40:39.191
<v Matthew Levy>but I'm going to have to shift to or
change to a different folder.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2436-2
00:40:39.191 --> 00:40:40.805
<v Matthew Levy>So let's open folder.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2441-0
00:40:44.005 --> 00:40:47.045
<v Matthew Levy>OK,
let me just stop sharing while I find it.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2462-0
00:40:54.445 --> 00:41:00.148
<v Nicolas Blank>And while Matthew is looking for things,
I'd like to encourage us to have any</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2462-1
00:41:00.148 --> 00:41:03.365
<v Nicolas Blank>questions in mind and and and don't be
shy.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2460-0
00:41:01.245 --> 00:41:01.645
<v Matthew Levy>Mm.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2468-0
00:41:05.005 --> 00:41:07.005
<v Matthew Levy>Yeah, I'm already tired of talking.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2473-0
00:41:23.325 --> 00:41:25.205
<v Matthew Levy>Alrighty.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2476-0
00:41:39.325 --> 00:41:39.605
<v Matthew Levy>Alright.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2483-0
00:41:43.765 --> 00:41:44.805
<v Matthew Levy>Yeah, let me share my screen.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2484-0
00:41:44.085 --> 00:41:45.485
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>So what are you looking for?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2526-0
00:41:46.445 --> 00:41:50.047
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>Matthew,
I was just gonna ask in terms of getting</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2495-0
00:41:49.125 --> 00:41:49.365
<v Matthew Levy>Yeah.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2526-1
00:41:50.047 --> 00:41:54.442
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>the extensions for Azure,
do you have to go and individually</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2502-0
00:41:51.845 --> 00:41:52.285
<v Matthew Levy>Hmm.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2526-2
00:41:54.442 --> 00:41:59.845
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>install each and everyone of them or
there's a pack where you can just OK.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2546-0
00:41:57.885 --> 00:42:01.830
<v Matthew Levy>No, there's a pack. Yeah, yeah,
so absolutely.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2546-1
00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:08.377
<v Matthew Levy>So the Azure Tools pack is the the one
that I use and and and this is similar</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2537-0
00:42:05.045 --> 00:42:08.245
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>Oh, OK.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2546-2
00:42:08.377 --> 00:42:12.405
<v Matthew Levy>for anything really.
There's even a PowerShell.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2547-0
00:42:13.405 --> 00:42:13.525
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>So.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2576-0
00:42:13.405 --> 00:42:18.795
<v Matthew Levy>Pack. So there's a GitHub pack.
There's there's all sorts. So yeah,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2576-1
00:42:18.795 --> 00:42:25.295
<v Matthew Levy>unless you've got individual extensions
that you know you want and you want to go</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2576-2
00:42:25.295 --> 00:42:26.325
<v Matthew Levy>and get them.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2573-0
00:42:27.245 --> 00:42:28.245
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>Yeah.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2606-0
00:42:27.445 --> 00:42:33.626
<v Matthew Levy>You do that or install packs. So yeah,
I I I like packs and you can create your</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2606-1
00:42:33.626 --> 00:42:38.030
<v Matthew Levy>own packs even.
So if you know of extensions for VS code</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2606-2
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:42.125
<v Matthew Levy>that you always need,
you can create your own packs.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2618-0
00:42:42.165 --> 00:42:46.773
<v Matthew Levy>I don't know if I can show you how to do
that now,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2618-1
00:42:46.773 --> 00:42:49.845
<v Matthew Levy>but because it's been a long time.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2651-0
00:42:47.525 --> 00:42:50.968
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>Yeah, I guess. Thanks for confirming that.
It's just,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2651-1
00:42:50.968 --> 00:42:56.132
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>I'm just trying to find a way obviously
to look at what's from a from a use case</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2651-2
00:42:56.132 --> 00:42:59.510
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>perspective,
look at what I could actually use in my</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2651-3
00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:01.805
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>day-to-day and what that looks like.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2642-0
00:43:01.285 --> 00:43:01.725
<v Matthew Levy>Mm.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2663-0
00:43:02.965 --> 00:43:05.435
<v Matthew Levy>Yeah,
so let me let me share my screen again</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2655-0
00:43:03.205 --> 00:43:04.285
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>So, so.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2663-1
00:43:05.435 --> 00:43:07.685
<v Matthew Levy>and I'll show you back on the extensions.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2683-0
00:43:12.325 --> 00:43:21.765
<v Matthew Levy>Tab I suppose of VS code. Where is it now?
Azure Tools is 12 extensions in one pack.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2687-0
00:43:23.445 --> 00:43:25.925
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>Yeah, there you go. Makes sense.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2690-0
00:43:25.605 --> 00:43:30.285
<v Matthew Levy>OK, yeah, yeah. And.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2722-0
00:43:32.645 --> 00:43:39.170
<v Matthew Levy>How did I? Where? I'm trying to.
So I've also got other things like GitHub</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2722-1
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:45.781
<v Matthew Levy>repos. That's an extension. Git lens.
Git lens is nice because it shows you</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2722-2
00:43:45.781 --> 00:43:48.565
<v Matthew Levy>what's been happening in a in a.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2770-0
00:43:48.565 --> 00:43:53.670
<v Matthew Levy>A repository other than what you've done.
So if other colleagues that you sync a</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2770-1
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:58.838
<v Matthew Levy>repository from have been working on it,
you'll see different branches and what's</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2770-2
00:43:58.838 --> 00:44:02.808
<v Matthew Levy>been changed and things like that. Again,
I'm not a developer,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2770-3
00:44:02.808 --> 00:44:06.968
<v Matthew Levy>so this stuff is probably like developers
do this in their sleep.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2770-4
00:44:06.968 --> 00:44:08.165
<v Matthew Levy>They know branches.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2787-0
00:44:08.245 --> 00:44:18.740
<v Matthew Levy>And forks and knives and spoons.
And I it's all it's basically cutlery to</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2787-1
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:19.165
<v Matthew Levy>me.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2796-0
00:44:20.645 --> 00:44:24.525
<v Matthew Levy>So what was I gonna show? Oh,
I was gonna show my um.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2802-0
00:44:25.645 --> 00:44:27.725
<v Matthew Levy>Handy little intergrou script.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2804-0
00:44:29.165 --> 00:44:31.325
<v Matthew Levy>So um.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2820-0
00:44:33.725 --> 00:44:40.605
<v Matthew Levy>O This author you'll see is GitHub
Copilot. Lovely. Let's zoom in a bit.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2824-0
00:44:44.485 --> 00:44:46.685
<v Matthew Levy>So this entire script um.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2845-0
00:44:48.205 --> 00:44:53.578
<v Matthew Levy>Creates enter ID groups from Jason
configuration files.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2845-1
00:44:53.578 --> 00:45:00.485
<v Matthew Levy>So I've got where would they be now?
Somewhere in here. Got some Jason.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2870-0
00:45:02.485 --> 00:45:08.338
<v Matthew Levy>I think it's these no groups.
It'll be under groups,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2870-1
00:45:08.338 --> 00:45:13.748
<v Matthew Levy>these JSON files that define certain
groups. OK,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2870-2
00:45:13.748 --> 00:45:18.165
<v Matthew Levy>this is for conditional access and then.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2909-0
00:45:20.005 --> 00:45:28.138
<v Matthew Levy>In the in the JSON file we've specified
that it is a role assignable group is</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2909-1
00:45:28.138 --> 00:45:35.019
<v Matthew Levy>assignable to role right?
So it knows that from the the file that</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2909-2
00:45:35.019 --> 00:45:39.085
<v Matthew Levy>it must be a role assignable group but.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2922-0
00:45:39.365 --> 00:45:44.139
<v Matthew Levy>Running the script, initialize variables,
created groups, skipped groups,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2922-1
00:45:44.139 --> 00:45:46.525
<v Matthew Levy>error groups, et cetera, et cetera O.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2960-0
00:45:47.445 --> 00:45:51.808
<v Matthew Levy>Uh, let's see. I don't.
I don't know if I'm connected to anything,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2960-1
00:45:51.808 --> 00:45:56.821
<v Matthew Levy>but let's see if I can just run the
script without actually creating things.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2960-2
00:45:56.821 --> 00:46:01.965
<v Matthew Levy>Just to show you what it looks like.
I just want to check it MG context. Oops.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2985-0
00:46:04.325 --> 00:46:14.301
<v Matthew Levy>Yeah, OK, so I'm not connected to graph,
which I would need to be for this to work.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2985-1
00:46:14.301 --> 00:46:19.645
<v Matthew Levy>Scripts, CD scripts, scripts, scripts,
Nope.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2987-0
00:46:25.085 --> 00:46:25.125
<v Matthew Levy>Uh.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2994-0
00:46:27.405 --> 00:46:30.725
<v Matthew Levy>Oh, I'm in a completely different folder.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/2999-0
00:46:35.285 --> 00:46:37.205
<v Matthew Levy>How about copy path?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3037-0
00:46:46.365 --> 00:46:49.056
<v Matthew Levy>OK,
and now what's the name of this</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3037-1
00:46:49.056 --> 00:46:53.316
<v Matthew Levy>PowerShell script?
If I'd written this PowerShell script</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3037-2
00:46:53.316 --> 00:46:56.979
<v Matthew Levy>myself,
I probably would have known exactly what</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3037-3
00:46:56.979 --> 00:47:01.015
<v Matthew Levy>it was called,
but because I've used the power of OK,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3037-4
00:47:01.015 --> 00:47:02.285
<v Matthew Levy>you can see I've.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3040-0
00:47:02.765 --> 00:47:04.925
<v Matthew Levy>Run it before and.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3065-0
00:47:07.605 --> 00:47:12.085
<v Nicolas Blank>That's the trouble with vibe coding is I
also vibe code things and then I go it</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3052-0
00:47:09.605 --> 00:47:10.085
<v Matthew Levy>Yeah.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3065-1
00:47:12.085 --> 00:47:14.325
<v Nicolas Blank>works so I won't actually go look at it.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3092-0
00:47:14.805 --> 00:47:20.067
<v Matthew Levy>Yeah, and and you kind of like, I'll,
I'll come back and use this again,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3092-1
00:47:20.067 --> 00:47:25.473
<v Matthew Levy>but then the next time you're like,
how did I do that again? So let's see,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3078-0
00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:22.285
<v Nicolas Blank>Yeah.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3092-2
00:47:25.473 --> 00:47:29.365
<v Matthew Levy>create better things.
There's the source for the the.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3099-0
00:47:29.845 --> 00:47:34.805
<v Matthew Levy>I don't know if that's the right place,
but let's see what happens.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3142-0
00:47:36.205 --> 00:47:39.596
<v Matthew Levy>Yeah, not connected. OK,
I need to connect.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3142-1
00:47:39.596 --> 00:47:44.836
<v Matthew Levy>But the the whole point is the script has
got error handling in it.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3142-2
00:47:44.836 --> 00:47:49.074
<v Matthew Levy>It's got colours,
it it's beautiful and it it asks me,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3142-3
00:47:49.074 --> 00:47:54.005
<v Matthew Levy>it's got parameters settings.
So you know commandlet binding I.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3190-0
00:47:54.205 --> 00:47:59.913
<v Matthew Levy>Have it asks me if I want to overwrite or
what was it here update existing.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3190-1
00:47:59.913 --> 00:48:05.995
<v Matthew Levy>So if they exist I can just update the
existing ones but not for role assignable</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3190-2
00:48:05.995 --> 00:48:11.928
<v Matthew Levy>groups you have to delete and recreate.
So it will do that for me if I've said</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3190-3
00:48:11.928 --> 00:48:13.805
<v Matthew Levy>update existing which is.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3193-0
00:48:14.125 --> 00:48:15.765
<v Matthew Levy>A little bit dangerous, but.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3198-0
00:48:16.485 --> 00:48:20.725
<v Matthew Levy>Now there's what is this script?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3234-0
00:48:22.325 --> 00:48:27.947
<v Matthew Levy>381 lines of code that I didn't write a
single line of.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3234-1
00:48:27.947 --> 00:48:33.669
<v Matthew Levy>I I prompted and my prompt was probably
about 200 lines,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3219-0
00:48:28.885 --> 00:48:29.525
<v Nicolas Blank>It's pretty cool.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3223-0
00:48:32.525 --> 00:48:32.565
<v Nicolas Blank>Oh.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3234-2
00:48:33.669 --> 00:48:37.885
<v Matthew Levy>but I I got what I wanted just from using.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3243-0
00:48:39.645 --> 00:48:44.468
<v Matthew Levy>Using the GitHub copilot,
I wonder if my prompts are still there</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3243-1
00:48:44.468 --> 00:48:44.765
<v Matthew Levy>now.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3246-0
00:48:47.285 --> 00:48:48.285
<v Matthew Levy>One month ago.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3282-0
00:48:52.685 --> 00:48:56.250
<v Matthew Levy>Oh, no. OK,
there is a way you can get back to the</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3282-1
00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:59.886
<v Matthew Levy>the prompts.
But anyway that's that was some of the</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3282-2
00:48:59.886 --> 00:49:03.940
<v Matthew Levy>cool stuff that I wanted to show and and
I think Nicolas,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3282-3
00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:07.645
<v Matthew Levy>I'm I'm at the 5 minute 2 mark so for
questions and.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3283-0
00:49:09.165 --> 00:49:09.285
<v Matthew Levy>Chat.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3336-0
00:49:11.245 --> 00:49:16.773
<v Nicolas Blank>I think from a rewinding point of view,
the installing extensions,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3336-1
00:49:16.773 --> 00:49:22.878
<v Nicolas Blank>that's a great place to start because we
don't often know where to start.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3300-0
00:49:16.885 --> 00:49:17.485
<v Matthew Levy>Hmm.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3310-0
00:49:18.805 --> 00:49:19.245
<v Matthew Levy>Yeah.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3336-2
00:49:22.878 --> 00:49:29.725
<v Nicolas Blank>And if you the easiest thing in the world
is to create a new file and tell GitHub.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3362-0
00:49:30.645 --> 00:49:35.164
<v Nicolas Blank>What it is and then paste something into
it and then you can create context like</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3362-1
00:49:35.164 --> 00:49:37.619
<v Nicolas Blank>that.
Also on the left hand side I think if</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3362-2
00:49:37.619 --> 00:49:41.636
<v Nicolas Blank>you're an infrastructure person,
this thing about file open new folder,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3362-3
00:49:41.636 --> 00:49:45.039
<v Nicolas Blank>that doesn't make sense.
So do you mind just explaining that</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3361-0
00:49:42.285 --> 00:49:45.045
<v Matthew Levy>Mm mm.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3362-4
00:49:45.039 --> 00:49:45.485
<v Nicolas Blank>quickly?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3372-0
00:49:46.005 --> 00:49:49.965
<v Matthew Levy>I'll open folder this bit, yeah.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3373-0
00:49:47.925 --> 00:49:51.165
<v Nicolas Blank>Open folder from yeah yeah.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3409-0
00:49:51.605 --> 00:49:58.025
<v Matthew Levy>Yeah, So what? Within VS Code,
I'm in a workspace and a workspace can</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3409-1
00:49:58.025 --> 00:50:03.252
<v Matthew Levy>contain folders.
I suppose from a developer perspective,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3409-2
00:50:03.252 --> 00:50:06.645
<v Matthew Levy>it's a project that you're busy with.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3429-0
00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:13.179
<v Matthew Levy>Different languages, different instances,
I don't know,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3429-1
00:50:13.179 --> 00:50:18.685
<v Matthew Levy>but for me it's just the the workspace
that I'm busy in I'll.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3447-0
00:50:19.805 --> 00:50:26.514
<v Matthew Levy>Keep the folders together.
You can't have multiple folders,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3447-1
00:50:26.514 --> 00:50:29.085
<v Matthew Levy>so the folder that I'm.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3469-0
00:50:30.245 --> 00:50:33.469
<v Matthew Levy>You know,
if I go and open Maester for example,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3469-1
00:50:33.469 --> 00:50:37.835
<v Matthew Levy>it will now switch to a completely
different view. Look at that,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3469-2
00:50:37.835 --> 00:50:40.925
<v Matthew Levy>this stuff on the right hand side.
Brilliant.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3475-0
00:50:42.045 --> 00:50:44.965
<v Matthew Levy>But it's only that folder I don't have.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3487-0
00:50:46.205 --> 00:50:51.125
<v Matthew Levy>Additional folders so you can't have
multiple folders in a workspace.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3537-0
00:50:53.765 --> 00:50:59.118
<v Matthew Levy>But it's useful to be able to open an
entire folder with a number of files</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3537-1
00:50:59.118 --> 00:51:02.616
<v Matthew Levy>within it.
So you you can absolutely just open a</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3537-2
00:51:02.616 --> 00:51:07.041
<v Matthew Levy>file, a single file.
But it's useful to open an entire folder</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3537-3
00:51:07.041 --> 00:51:12.965
<v Matthew Levy>like what I did just now with my interest
stuff. There's a folder I know I've got.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3559-0
00:51:13.605 --> 00:51:18.670
<v Matthew Levy>Jason files in that folder.
I've got the PowerShell script in the</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3559-1
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:22.738
<v Matthew Levy>folder and other things,
so I would open the folder.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3559-2
00:51:22.738 --> 00:51:26.805
<v Matthew Levy>Does that answer your question on the
folders thing?</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3560-0
00:51:27.925 --> 00:51:28.005
<v Matthew Levy>Um.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3592-0
00:51:30.405 --> 00:51:38.597
<v Matthew Levy>The the extensions and Blessing you,
you know you raised a good question which</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3592-1
00:51:38.597 --> 00:51:46.685
<v Matthew Levy>extensions to install for Azure and the
packs are really useful that you can.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3620-0
00:51:47.045 --> 00:51:53.010
<v Matthew Levy>Search for extensions,
but then I also see that the why is it</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3620-1
00:51:53.010 --> 00:52:00.996
<v Matthew Levy>not showing? Oh, recommended is hidden.
VS code will recommend extensions as well,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3620-2
00:52:00.996 --> 00:52:01.765
<v Matthew Levy>so like.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3655-0
00:52:02.445 --> 00:52:08.264
<v Matthew Levy>Notepad keymap. I don't know what that is,
but maybe I want to take a look at it.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3655-1
00:52:08.264 --> 00:52:13.301
<v Matthew Levy>Get our ull requests Kubernetes.
I'm doing maybe some container stuff.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3655-2
00:52:13.301 --> 00:52:16.565
<v Matthew Levy>Maybe I want to get the Kubernetes
extension.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3661-0
00:52:17.525 --> 00:52:22.045
<v Matthew Levy>Although that's another scary asect for
me. Um.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3689-0
00:52:23.765 --> 00:52:28.936
<v Matthew Levy>But if you are working with containers,
you probably would want that. So yeah,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3689-1
00:52:28.936 --> 00:52:32.013
<v Matthew Levy>it's it.
VS Code is quite intuitive in kind of</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3689-2
00:52:32.013 --> 00:52:34.565
<v Matthew Levy>showing you where to go and how to get.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3719-0
00:52:35.525 --> 00:52:40.427
<v Matthew Levy>A little bit more and every time I open
VS Code I learn something new. Oh,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3719-1
00:52:40.427 --> 00:52:44.806
<v Matthew Levy>what does that do? Oh look,
do you want to install the recommended</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3719-2
00:52:44.806 --> 00:52:49.054
<v Matthew Levy>dev containers extension for Microsoft
from this repository? No,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3719-3
00:52:49.054 --> 00:52:50.165
<v Matthew Levy>I don't think so.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3721-0
00:52:52.245 --> 00:52:52.605
<v Matthew Levy>So yeah.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3722-0
00:52:54.485 --> 00:52:54.765
<v Blessing Bowora | Cyberlogic>Yes.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3774-0
00:52:58.245 --> 00:53:01.567
<v Matthew Levy>So just to recap,
what I did was I showed you the</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3735-0
00:52:58.525 --> 00:53:00.925
<v Nicolas Blank>A lot. Go on.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3774-1
00:53:01.567 --> 00:53:06.483
<v Matthew Levy>extensions, I showed you accounts.
So don't forget if you want to use the</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3774-2
00:53:06.483 --> 00:53:09.539
<v Matthew Levy>GitHub copilot,
you need to sign into GitHub.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3774-3
00:53:09.539 --> 00:53:13.325
<v Matthew Levy>So the little monarchy there,
click on that and sign in.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3834-0
00:53:13.685 --> 00:53:19.358
<v Matthew Levy>I've also got my Azure tenant signed in.
Oh, I didn't talk about backup and sync.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3834-1
00:53:19.358 --> 00:53:24.547
<v Matthew Levy>So if you have a GitHub account,
you can sync your settings for VS Code to</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3834-2
00:53:24.547 --> 00:53:30.359
<v Matthew Levy>GitHub so that you can then go to another
machine and just install VS Code and sync</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3834-3
00:53:30.359 --> 00:53:32.365
<v Matthew Levy>your settings and it'll sync.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3861-0
00:53:32.445 --> 00:53:36.164
<v Matthew Levy>Sync all the extensions, how it looks,
your rofiles,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3861-1
00:53:36.164 --> 00:53:41.285
<v Matthew Levy>all of that to your new machine so you
don't have to start from scratch.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3871-0
00:53:43.205 --> 00:53:48.056
<v Matthew Levy>You can using the Azure Resources
extension.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3871-1
00:53:48.056 --> 00:53:52.045
<v Matthew Levy>You can work with resources in Azure.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3906-0
00:53:54.245 --> 00:53:59.057
<v Matthew Levy>You've got profiles that you can set how
you want things to look.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3906-1
00:53:59.057 --> 00:54:04.524
<v Matthew Levy>I'll just switch to the doc writer
profile just to show you how it changes</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3906-2
00:54:04.524 --> 00:54:08.607
<v Matthew Levy>colors and things.
It's a little bit easier on my eyes,</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3906-3
00:54:08.607 --> 00:54:11.085
<v Matthew Levy>but it's not great for presenting.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3907-0
00:54:12.765 --> 00:54:12.885
<v Matthew Levy>Um.</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3937-0
00:54:15.925 --> 00:54:19.486
<v Matthew Levy>Yeah,
and then some of the GitHub niceness that</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3937-1
00:54:19.486 --> 00:54:25.345
<v Matthew Levy>I played with using the different the
agent mode and the different models that</v>

fe3dedfb-cd6b-4f04-b2f4-55a6fe8e79e6/3937-2
00:54:25.345 --> 00:54:29.425
<v Matthew Levy>you can use.
